We have great pleasure in offering you this General Science \n\ntextbook based on the new syllabus. From Primary level till today, you have studied \nScience through various textbooks. From std 8th onwards, you will be able to study the \nfundamental concepts and technology through the medium of different branches of \nScience. \n\nThe basic purpose of this 'General Science' text book is 'Understand and explain to \nothers' the science that relates to our day to day lives. While studying the concepts, \nprinciples and theories in Science, understand their connection to daily affairs. While \nstudying this textbook, use the sections 'Can you recall? and 'Can you tell?' for revision. \nYou will learn Science through many activities given under the titles such as 'Observe \nand discuss' and 'Try this' or ' Let's try this'. Activities like 'Use your brain power', \n'Research', 'Think about it' will stimulate your thinking power. We insist that you must \nperform all these activities. \n\nMany experiments have been included in this text book. Follow the given procedure, \nmake your own observations and conclusions to perform these experiments. You can ask \nfor help from your teachers, parents or classmates - whenever needed. This book reveals \nthe Science, interesting information and the developed technology behind many day to \nday happenings. All of this is explainecd through the medium of activities.\n\nIn today's world of speedy technology, you are already close to computers and \nsmartphones. While studying this textbook, make full and proper use of Information and \nCommunication Technology tools.\n\nFor effective learning, Q.R. code app will provide you additional infromation, \nuseful audio-visual material regarding each lesson. This will definitely help you and \nmake you content rich.\n\nWhile performing given activities and experiments take all precautions regarding \nhandling of apparatus, chemicals etc. and encourage others to do the same.\n\nWhen the activities involve plants and animals, you must perform them keeping in \nmind the nature and environment conservation. Harm to animals and plants must be \nstrictly avoided. \n\nDo communicate with us about the part you liked as well as about the difficulties \nthat you faced while reading, understanding  and studying the book. Our best wishes for \n\nyour academic progress.       \n\n\n\nF\n\nl The real objective of science education is to develop the ability to think logically and with \ndiscretion about events that are happening around us.\n\nl From std IIIrd to Vth we have explained easy science to our students through the medium \nof 'Environmental Study'  while from std VIth to VIIth we are introducing them Science \nthrough the text books.\n\nl Considering the age group std 8th students, they should be given an opportunity and scope \nfor their curiousity about the events of the world, their propensity to find out the causes \nbehind them and to develop their own initiative and capacity to take the lead.\n\nl In the process of learning Science,  the skill of performing experiments is necessary for \nobservation, logic, conclusion, comparison and application of recieved information. \nTherefore purposeful efforts must be taken to develop all these skills. All the observations \nby the students should be accepted and we should help them to reach upto expected \nconclusion.\n\nl It is our responsibility that students will take interest to enrich their science. As usual, \nyou must be leading to develop scientific attitude, creativity, skills and content in your \nstudents.\n\nl You can use ‘Let’s recall’ to review the previous knowledge required for a lesson and ‘Can \nyou tell?’ to introduce a topic by eliciting all the knowledge that the students already have \nfrom their own reading experience. You may of course use any of your own activities or \nquestions for this. Activities given under ‘Try this’ and ‘Let’s try this’ help to explain the \ncontent. Former are for students to do themselves and latter are those that you are expected \nto demonstrate. \n\n ‘Use your brain power!’ is meant for application of previous knowledge as well as the \nnew lesson, and ‘Always remember’ gives important suggestions/information or values. \n‘Research’, ‘Find out’, ‘Do you know?’, ‘Introduction to scientists’ and ‘Institutes at work’ \nare meant to give some information about the world outside the textbook and to develop \nthe habit of doing independent reference work to obtain additional information.\n\nl This textbook is not meant only for reading and explaining but to guide students to obtain \nknowledge through activities. An informal atmosphere in the classroom is required to \nachieve the aims of this textbook. Encourage more  and more student to participate in \ndiscussions, experiments and activities. Special efforts should be made to organise \npresentations or report-reading in the class based on students’ activities and projects. \nScience Day and other relevant occasions/ days must be observed.\n\nl The science content of the textbook has been complemented with Information \nCommunication Technology. To study different scientific contents these techniques must \nbe used under your observation. Also you should encourage the students to gain additional \ninformation by using Q.R. codes.\n\nFor Teachers\n\nFront and back covers : Pictures of various activities, experiments and concepts in the book.\n\nDISCLAIMER Note : All attempts have been made to contact copy righters (©) but we have not heard from them. \nWe will be pleased to acknowledge the copy right holder (s) in our next edition if we learn from them.\n\n\n\nG\n\nLearning Outcomes : Standard VIII\n\nThe learner...\n\n08.72.01  differentiates materials and organisms, such \nas, natural and human made fibres; contact \nand non -contact forces; liquids as electrical \nconductors and insulators; plant and animal \ncells; viviparous and oviparous animals,on \nthe basis of their properties, structure and \nfunctions.\n\n08.72.02 classifies materials and organisms based \non properties /characteristics, for example, \nmetals and non metals; useful and harmful \nmicroorganisms; sexual and asexual \nreproduction; celestial objects; exhaustible \nand inexhaustible natural resources, etc. \n\n08.72.03 conducts simple investigations to seek \nanswers to queries, for example, What are \nthe conditions required for combustion ? \nWhy do we add salt and sugar in pickles and \nmurambas?

What is the hierarchy for classification of living organisms?\n2. Who invented ‘bionomial system’ of nomenclature?\n3. Which levels of hierarchy are considered while writing the name \n\nin binomial nomenclature?\n\nBiodiversity and need of classification\n       Last year we learnt that all the living \norganism on earth have adapted according to \ngeographic regions, food ingestion, defence etc. \nWhile adapting, many differences are observed \nin the organisms of same species too.\n      According to 2011 census, around 87 million \nspecies of living organisms are found on the \nearth- including land and sea. To study such a \nvast number, it was essential to divide them into \ngroups. So groups and subgroups were created \nconsidering the similarities and differences \namong the living organisms.\n     This process of dividing living organism \ninto groups and subgroups is called Biological \nclassification.\n\nRobert Harding Whittaker (1920-1980) was an American Ecologist. In 1969 he divided \nliving organisms into 5 groups.\n\nIn History......\n• Carl Linnaeus in 1735 divided \n\nliving world in 2 kingdoms -\n Vegetabilia and  Animalia.\n• Haeckel in 1866 considered 3 \n\nkingdoms- Protista, Plants and \nAnimals.\n\n• In 1925 - Chatton created \ntwo groups Prokaryotes and \nEukaryotes.\n\n• In 1938 Kopland divided living \norganisms into 4 kingdoms- \nMonera, Protista, Plants and \nAnimals.\n\nFor this classification Whittaker \nconsidered following criteria\n1. Complexity of cell structure : \n\nProkaryotic and Eukaryotic.\n2. Complexity of organisms : \n\nUnicellular or Multicellular.\n3. Mode of nutrition :\n Plants -  Autotrophic- \n\nPhotosynthetic\n Fungi- Saprophytic- Absorption \n\nfrom dead organisms.\n Animals- Heterotrophic and \n\ningestive.\n4.  Life style : \n Plants - Producers\n Animals - Consumers\n Fungi - Decomposers\n5. Phylogenetic relationship :\n Prokaryotic to Eukaryotic, \n\nunicellular to multicellular.\n\nLiving Organisms\n\nProkaryotes Eukaryotes\n\nMulticellularUnicellular                                                     Unicellular                             \n\nKingdom1. Monera Kingdom 2. Protista\n\nKingdom 5. \nAnimalia\nNo cell wall\n\n1.1 Five Kingdom system of classification\n\nKingdom 3. \nFungi \nCell wall \npresent \nbut organisms \ncan’t perform \nphotosynthesis.\n\nKingdom 4. \nPlantae\nCell wall present \nand organisms \ncan performs \nphotosynthesis \n\nCan you recall?\n\n\n\n2\n\n1.2 Organisms from Kingdom Monera\n\nClostridium tetani\n\nTreponema \npallidum\n\nVibrio choleri\n\nSalmonella\ntyphi\n\nStaphylococcus\naureus\n\nLegionella\npneumoniae\n\nStreptococcus\npneumoniae\n\nSporangium\n\n1.4 Fungi\n\n1.3 Organisms from Kingdom Protista\n\nInstitutional Work : National Institute of Virology, Pune is involved in research on viruses. \nThis institute has been founded in 1952 under the jurisdiction of Indian Council of Medical \nResearch.\n\nKingdom 1 : Monera\nActivity : Take a small drop of curd or \nbuttermilk on a clean glass slide. Dilute \nit with a little water. Carefully keep a \ncover slip. Observe it under high power of \ncompound microscope. What did you see ?\n Moving, small rod-like microbes are \nlactobacilli bacteria.\n   All type of bacteria and blue green algae \nare included in the kingdom Monera.\nCharacteristics :\n1. All the organisms are unicellular.\n2. They may be autotrophic or heterotrophic.\n3. These are prokaryotic cells without distinct \n\nnucleus or cell organelles\n\nKingdom 2. Protista\nActivity : Prepare a temporary mount of \none drop of pond water on a glass slide. \nObserve it under low power and high power \nof microscope. You will find some motile \nmicrobes with irregular shape. These are \namoebae.\nCharacteristic :\n1. Protista are single celled organisms with \n\nwell defined nucleus enclosed in a nuclear \nmembrane.\n\n2. They have pseudopodia or hair like cilia \nor whip like flagella for locomotion.\n\n3. Autotrophs- eg. Euglena, Volvox contain \nchloroplast.\n\n Heterotrophs- eg. Amoeba, Paramoecium\n\nKingdom 3. Fungi\nActivity : Take a moist piece of bread or \nbhakri and keep it in a container with lid for \n2-3 days. After 2-3 days a fine cotton thread \nlike tuft is found growing on the surface of \nthe bread. Prepare a temporary mount of \nfew threads from this culture and observe it \nunder the microscope.\n\nClostridium\nbotulinum\n\nVolvox \nParamoecium\n\nEuglena Amoeba\n\nColumella\n\nApophysis\n\nSporangiophoreHypha\n\nRhizoids\n\nTry this\n\n\n\n3\n\n1.5 Some Fungi\n\nMicroorganisms With reference to size of microbes, \nremember- \n\n1 meter = 106 micrometer (mm)\n1 meter = 109 nanometer (nm)\n\n1.6 Classification of Microorganisms\n\n1. Bacteria (size – 1 mm to 10 mm)\n1. Unicellular, independent / parasitic \n\norganisms. Sometimes many bacteria \ntogether form colonies.\n\n2. Bacterial cell is prokaryotic with cell wall, \nbut distinct nucleus or cell organelles are \nabsent.\n\n3. They reproduce by simple binary fission.\n4. In favourable conditions, bacteria grow \n\nvigorously and can double their number in \n20 minutes. \n\nExplain merits and demerits of \nWhittaker’s classification.\n\nClassification of Microbes\nAmong the living organisms, microorganisms are largest in \n\nnumber. Hence they are classified as follows. \n\nCharacteristics :\n1. These are non-green, eukaryotic, heterotrophic organisms.\n2. Most of them are saprotrophs. They feed upon decaying organic \n\nmatter.\n3. Their cell wall is made up of tough and complex sugar called \n\n‘Chitin’.\n4. Some fungi are thread like and many nuclei are present in the \n\ncytoplasm.\n5. Examples- Baker’s yeast, Aspergillus (Fungus on corn), \n\nPenicillium, Mushrooms.\nThough many systems of classification are introduced after the \n\nWhittaker's, his five kingdom system is widely accepted. \n\nProkaryotes Eukaryotes\n\n Bacteria Protista Fungi Algae\n\n1.7 Some Bacteria\n\nCoccus\n\nCocco-bacillus \n\nBacillus\n\nVibrio (Comma shaped)\n\nSpirillum\n\nUse your brain power\n\n\n\n4\n\nSaccharomyces\n\nParamoecium\n\nTomato Wilt Virus\n\n1.8 Some Microorganisms\n\nPlasmodium \n\nEntamoeba\n\n2. Protozoa (size - approximately 200 mm)\n1. Protozoans are found in soil, fresh water and sea water. Some \n\nare found in the body of other organisms and are pathogenic.\n2. These are unicellular organisms with eukaryotic cell.\n3. There is great variation in cell structure, organs of locomotion \n\nand modes of nutrition among protozoans.\n4. These organisms reproduce by simple cell division.\n Eg.- Amoeba, Paramoecium - Free living in dirty water.\n Entamoeba histolytica  - causes amoebiasis.\n Plasmodium vivax- causes malaria\n Euglena - autotrophic\n\n3.Fungi- (size- approximately 10 mm to 100 mm)\n1. These are found on decaying organic matter and dead bodies \n\nof plants and animals.\n2. These are eukaryotic organisms. Some are unicellular and \n\nothers are visible with naked eyes.\n3. Saprotrophic, absorb their food from decaying organic \n\nmatter.\n4. They reproduce sexually and asexually by cell division or \n\nby budding.\n Eg. Baker's yeast, Candida, Mushroom.\n\n4. Algae- (size- approximately  10 mm to 100 mm)\n1. They are aquatic.\n2.  Eukaryotic, unicellular, autotrophic organisms.\n3. Photosynthesis is carried out with the help of chloroplast \n\npresent in the cell.\n Eg. Chlorella, Chlamydomonas\n very few species of algae are unicellular. Most of them are  \n\nmulticellular and visible with naked eyes.\n\n5. Viruses-( size- approximately 10 nm to 100 nm)       \nGenerally, viruses are not considered as living organisms \n\nor they are said to be “Organisms at the edge of living and \nnonliving.” They are studied under microbiology.\n1. Viruses are extremely minute i.e. they are 10 to 100 times \n\nsmaller than bacteria and can be seen only with electron \nmicroscope.\n\n2. They are found in the form of independent particles .\n Virus is a long molecule of  DNA (Deoxyribo Nucleic Acid) \n\nor RNA (Ribo Nucleic Acid) covered by a protein coat.\n3. Viruses survive only in living plant or animal cells and  \n\nproduce their own proteins with help of host cell and create \ntheir numerous replica. Then they destroy the host cell and \nbecome free. These free viruses again infect new cells.\n\n4. Viruses cause many diseases to plants and animals.\n\nChlorella\n\n\n\n5\n\n1.

Diagnostic facilities \n\nare available in National Institute of \n\nVirology (NIV), Pune and National \n\nInstitute of Communicable Diseases \n\n(NICD), Delhi.  \n\nAIDS (Acquired Immuno  Deficiency Syndrome) : This disease \nis caused by HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus). In this \ndisease, victim suffer from various diseases due to progressive \nweakening of natural immunity. Diagnosis of AIDS cannot be \nconfirmed without tests in medical laboratories. ELISA test is \nused for its proper diagnosis. Symptoms of AIDS are person \nspecific.\n\nInfections through Animals\n\n1. Which measures are taken at your home to control the rats?\n2. Why is it necessary to care about health of domestic dogs, cats \n\nand birds?\n3. Is there any relation between pigeons, stray animals and human \n\nhealth?\n4. What are effects of rats, cockroaches on human health?\n\n HIV was first reported in an African \nspecies of Monkeys. According to the \nNational AIDS Control Program and \nUNAIDS, 80 – 85% HIV infections in \nIndia occur through unsafe sexual \ncontacts. \n\nRabies: This is a viral disease. It occurs due to the bite of \nthe infected dog, rabbit, monkey, cat etc. Virus enters the \nbrain via neurons. Hydrophobia is one of the important \nsymptom of this disease. In this case, the victim shows \nextreme fear for water. Rabies is fatal disease.  However, \nfatality can be prevented by timely vaccination before \nonset of symptoms. Symptoms start to appear within 90 – \n175 days of dog bite. \n\nSymptoms of Rabies:\n1. Fever for 2 – 12 weeks\n2. Exaggerations in behaviour.\n3. Hydrophobia.\n\n \nl AIDS does not occur due to touching to \n\nand sharing the food with HIV infected \nperson, or by nursing the HIV patient.\n\nl\tOur behaviour with HIV infected \nperson must be normal.\n\n     First case of swine flu was reported \nin Mexico in 2009. Swine flu is caused \nby the virus influenza A (H\n\n1\nN\n\n1\n). Persons \n\nwho come in contact with pigs can \ncontract this disease.\n\nDo you know?\n\nDo you know?\nAlways remember\n\nCan you tell?\n\nInternet My Friend\n1.

Why the animal cages and their living places should not be near \nthe kitchen?\n\n2. Depending upon which symptoms, rabies can be identified?\n\nB. Non-infectious diseases : Diseases \nwhich do not occur through infections and \nbody contacts are called as non-infectious \ndiseases. Such diseases arise in human body \nitself due to certain reasons.\n1. Cancer : Uncontrolled and abnormal cell \ngrowth is called as cancer. Group or lump \nof cancerous cells is called as malignant \ntumor. Cancer can occur in various organs \nlike lungs, mouth, tongue, stomach, breast, \nuterus, skin and tissues like blood.\nReasons : Consumption of tobacco, gutkha, \nsmoking, alcoholism, lack of fiber content \n(fruits and leafy vegetables) in food, \nexcessive consumption of junk food (pizza, \nburger etc) are some of the many possible \nreasons. Heredity may also be a reason.\nSymptoms : \n1. Chronic cough, hoarse voice, difficulty in \n\nswallowing.\n2. Incurable scar and inflammation.\n3. Lumps in breast.\n4. Unexplained weight-loss.\n\nDo you remember any person drinking the sugar-free tea or \navoiding consumption of sweets? What may be the possible reason \nfor this?\n\n2. Diabetes: The hormone- insulin produced \nin pancreas controls the level of sugar- \nglucose in blood. If insulin is secreted in low \nquantity, glucose level cannot be controlled; \nthis disorder is called as diabetes. \n\nSymptoms which cannot be ignored- \n• Frequent urination at night, increased \nobesity or weight loss\nReasons for diabetes : • Heredity  • Obesity \n • Lack of physical exercise • Mental stress\n\nPreventive measures: Following the proper diet, medicines and exercise under the \nsupervision of doctor helps to keep the diabetes under control.\n\nModern diagnostics and treatment of \ncancer : Various techniques like CT \nscan, MRI scan, mammography, biopsy \nare used in diagnosis of cancer. In case \nof treatment, along with conventional \nmethods like chemotherapy, radiation \ntherapy and surgery, modern techniques \nlike robotic and laparoscopic surgery are \nalso followed. \n\nDiscuss \n\nCan you tell?\n\nCan you tell?\n\nDo you know?\n\nControlled diet helps to prevent some \ntypes of cancers. Physical exercise along \nwith modern treatment is more beneficial \nto cure the cancer.\n\nAvoid addictions like tobacco \nchewing, smoking etc.\n\nAlways remember\n\nDiscuss the control of cancer and prepare \nposter for the displaying in classroom.\n\n\n\n11\n\nIndia has largest number of diabetes \npatients in the world. At present, \napproximately 7 crore diabetes patients \nare present in the country. \n\nInternet My Friend\nWatch the various videos giving \n\ninformation about diabetes on internet. \nNote important information and present \nit in the class using MS-power point \npresentation.\n\nFirst Aid for Heart Disease\nFirst, call 108 for ambulance. Check \n\nthe consciousness of patient by shaking \nthe shoulders. Keep the patient lying on \nthe back in horizontal position on hard \nsurface and perform compression only \nlife support (C. O. L. S.). In this, press the \ncentre of thorax for at least 30 times at \nthe rate of 100 to 120 strokes per minute.\n\nAngioplasty\n\nHeart \ntransplant\n\nInstallation \nof stents\n\nInstallation\nof pace maker\n\nOpen\nheart\n\nsurgery  \n\nBy-Pass\nsurgery\n\nHeart diseases\n\n \nEach disease has specific scientific \n\nreason. Diseases do not occur due to \ndivine curse or hating by any one. \nDiseases can be cured by proper \nmedical treatment and not by chanting \nmantras or performing magic tricks.\n\n1. Have you ever seen your grandparents \ntaking the decoction? Discuss about it with \nthem.\n\n2. Collect information from your grandparents \nabout use of aloe vera, turmeric, ginger, \ngarlic as medicines. \n\nInternet My Friend\n\nCollect the information about \n\ndifferent methods of treatment like \n\nayurveda, homeopathy, natural \n\nhealing, allopathy, unani, etc.\n\n3. Heart Diseases : Efficiency of the heart \ndecreases due to decreased blood supply and \nthereby oxygen and nutrient supply to the heart \nmuscles. Due to this, heart has to perform \nmore work that leads to stress on it. This may \ncause heart attack. If someone has heart attack, \nimmediate consultation of doctor and treatment \nis necessary.\nOne should not ignore these symptoms\n\nSevere chest pains, pains in shoulder, neck \nand arms, cramps in hand, uneasiness, tremors.\n\nMisuse of Medicines : Sometimes, some people take the medicines without prescription of \ndoctor. Overdose of medicines may affect our body. Ex. Overdose of pain killers may damage \nnervous system, excretory system, liver. Overdose of antibiotics may lead to nausea, stomach \nache, dysentery, rash, white patches on tongue etc.\n\nReasons of heart attack : Smoking, alcoholism, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, lack of \nphysical exercise, heredity, mental stress, anger, anxiety.\n\nDo you know?\n\nAlways remember\n\nAlways remember\n\nCollect information\n\n\n\n12\n\nLet us celebrate Health Awareness Days\n\n7th April – World Health Day   14th June – World Blood Donation Day\n29th September – World Heart day    14th November – World Diabetes Day\n\n* Government of India declared the Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadhi Yojana on 1st July 2015. \nIn this scheme, best quality medicines are made available in affordable prices to the \ncitizens. 'Jan Aushadhi Stores' are launched for this purpose.\n\n*  Indian companies export the generic medicines on large scale. However, those medicines \nare sold under brand name with high prices in India. In America, 80% medicines used \nare generic. Due to this, hundreds of billions of money is saved there.\n\nGeneric medicines : Generic medicines are \nalso known as general medicines. These are \nmanufactured and distributed without any \npatent. These medicines are at par in quality \nwith branded medicines. Production cost of these \nmedicines is very low due to fewer expenses on \nresearch as their formula is readily available.\n\nUse of ICT\nYou can easily obtain the generic \n\nmedicines using mobile apps like \nHealthkart and Jan Samadhan. \nDownload those apps on your mobile \nand use it if necessary. \n\nLifestyle and diseases : Lifestyle includes the daily routine and the type of food. Nowadays, \nhabits like staying in bed till late morning and going to bed late in night, frequent changes in \nmeal timings, lack of physical exercise, consumption of junk food, etc. have been increased. \nDue to this, such people are getting sick frequently. \n\nIf frequency of becoming sick is to be lowered, people should follow right lifestyle. It must \ninclude sufficient sleep, right food, yogasanas, pranayam and physical exercise. Physical \nexercise should also be as per one’s own capacity.\n\nPranayam and yogasanas should be performed under the expert supervision. See the \nvideos of pranayam and yogasanas.\nVaccination: Vaccination is important to prevent the infectious diseases.

Force and Pressure\n\n3.1 Various Actions\n\n3.2 Some events\n\nWhat is a force?\n\nContact and Non contact forces : In fig. 3.1 a car moves in forward direction when a man \napplies force from behind. A reluctant dog is being pulled by his master and a boy playing \nfootball is kicking the ball away. What do you observe from these? A force acts on two bodies \nthrough an interaction between them. \n\n A stationary object on which no force is acting, remains stationary. An object in motion \ncontinues to move with the same speed and direction when no force is acting on the object. \nThis is Newton’s first law of motion.\n\nAs seen in fig 3.2, iron nails get \nattracted to the pole of a magnet \ndue to magnetic force. \n\nA coconut is falling from the coconut \ntree. Objects are attracted to the earth due to \nthe force of gravity. When a comb gets \nrubbed against hair, small pieces of paper \nkept on a table get attracted to the comb. The \ncomb has an electrostatic charge and there is \nan induced opposite charge on the pieces of \npaper and the pieces stick to the comb.\n\nIn fig 3.1 a force is seen to act through a \ndirect contact of the objects or via one more \nobject. Such a force is called ‘Contact force’. \nIn fig 3.2, a force is applied between two \nobjects even if the two objects are not in \ncontact, such a force is called a ‘Non contact \nforce’.\n Muscular force is an example of contact \nforce and is applied to objects with the help \nof our muscles. It is applied in several cases \nsuch as lifting, pushing, pulling. On the \n\ncontrary, forces like magnetic force, \ngravitational force, electrostatic force act \nwithout a contact. Therefore, these are the \nexamples of non contact forces.\n When a ball is kept on a table and \npushed a little, it moves ahead and gets slow \nand stops. A car running on a plane road \ntravels some distance and stops after the \nengine is switched off. This is because of the \nforce of friction between the ground surface \nand the object in motion. In the absence of \nfrictional force, the object would have \nremained in motion. Frictional force is very \nuseful in daily life. While walking, we push \nthe ground behind with our feet. In the \nabsense of friction, we will slip and will not \nbe able to walk. All the objects in motion \nhave a frictional force acting on them which \nis acting in the direction opposite to the \n\nObserve the pictures in figures 3.1 and 3.2.\n\nCan you recall?\n\nObserve\n\n\n\n15\n\n3.3 Non contact force\n\ndirection of motion. You must have seen that one tends to slip over banana peel on the street. \nSimilarly one can slip due to mud. Both these examples occur due to reduced friction.\n\nMake a list of some more examples in which contact and \nnon contact forces are applied. Write the types of force.\n\nBalanced and unbalanced force \n\nTake two plastic bottles with rectangular shape. Close their \nopenings by fitting the lids tightly. Keep two small bar magnets on \nthem and fix them neatly using a sticking tape. (fig 3.3)\n\n Fill a big plastic tray with water and leave the \ntwo bottles floating with magnets at the top. Take \none  bottle near the other. If the north pole of the \nmagnet is near the south pole of the other magnet, \nthe bottles will head towards each other, because \nunlike poles attract each other. Observe what will \n\nhappen when the directions of the bottles are changed. We can observe change in the motion \nof the bottles without any direct contact. This means that there exists a non contact force \nbetween the two magnets.\n\nYou have learnt about static electricity in the previous \nstandard. Electrostatic force is a non contact force. To verify \nthis, which experiment will you perform? \n\n Take a cardboard box, tie thick string to its two sides and \nkeep it on a smooth table as shown in fig. 3.4. Take the strings \non both sides of the table. Tie weighing pans of equal masses to \nthe two ends. Keep equal masses in both the pans. The box does \nnot move on the table. If more mass is kept in one of the pans \nthan in the other, the box starts moving in the direction of that \npan. Equal gravitational force acts on both the pans when equal \nmasses are kept in them. This means balanced forces act on the \nbox, with effective force equal to zero as these are acting in \nopposite directions. On the contrary, if more mass is kept in one \npan than in the other, the box starts moving in the direction of \nthe pan with more mass. When unequal forces are applied to the \nbox on the two sides, an unbalanced force acts on the box \nresulting in imparting motion to the box. \n\nChildren playing tug of war pull the rope in their respective directions. If the pull of the \nforce is equal on the two sides, the rope does not move. If the force is more on one side, the \nrope moves in that direction. This means that initially, the two forces are balanced; the rope \nmoves in the direction of higher force when the forces become unbalanced. \n\nLet us see one more example. When big grain storage container is required to slide on the \nground, it becomes easier if two persons push it rather than one person. When the force is \napplied by both in the same direction, the movement is easy. You may have experienced this. \nWhat do we understand from this example?\n\nUse your brain power\n\nUse your brain power\n\nTry this\n\nTry this\n\n3.4 Balanced and \nunbalanced force\n\n\n\n16\n\n The tendency of an object to remain \nin its existing state is called its inertia. \nThis is why an object in stationary state \nremains in the same state and an obect in \nmotion remain in the state of motion in \nthe absence of an external force.\n\nIf more than one \nforce are acting on a \nbody, then the effect on \nthe body is due to the net \nforce.\n\na. If several forces are applied on an object in the same direction, a force equal to their \naddition acts on that object.\n\nb. If two forces are applied on one object in directions opposite to each other, a force equal to \ntheir difference acts on the object.\n\nc. A force is expressed in magnitude and direction. Force is a vector quantity.\n When a force is applied on a stationary object it moves, its  \nspeed and direction change. Similarly, a force is required to stop \nan object in motion. An object can change its shape due to force. \nWhile kneading a dough made from flour, the dough changes its \nshape when a force is applied. A potter applies a force in a \nspecific direction while shaping the pot. Rubber band, when \nstretched, expands. There are many such examples.\n\nInertia : We have seen that an object changes its state of motion due to force. In the absence \nof a force, objects exhibit a tendency to remain in the existing state of motion. Let us see the \nfollowing examples.\n\nActivity 1 : Take a postcard and keep it on a glass. Keep a 5 Rupee coin \non it. Now skillfully push the card. The coin straight away falls in the \nglass. Have you ever done this? \n\nTypes of inertia : 1. Inertia of the state \nof rest : An object in the state of rest can \nnot change its state of rest due to its \ninherent property. This property is called \nthe inertia of the state of rest. 2. Inertia of \nmotion : The inherent property of an \nobject due to which its state of motion can \nnot change, is called its inertia of motion. \nFor exmaple a revolving electric fan \ncontinues to revolve even after it is \nswitched off, passengers sitting in the \nrunning bus get a jerk in the forward \ndirection if the bus suddenly stops.                 \n3. Directional inertia : The inherent \nproperty of an object due to which the \nobject can not change the direction of its \nmotion, is called directional intertia. For \nexample, if a vehicle in motion along a \nstraight line suddenly turns, the passengers \nsitting in it are thrown opposite to the \ndirection of turning.\n\nActivity 2 : Hang a half a kg mass to a stand, \nwith a string 1. Tie another string 2 to the mass \nand keep it hanging. Now pull the string 2 with a \njerk. The string 2 breaks but the mass does not \nfall. Heavy mass does not move. Now pull the \nstring 2 slowly. The string 1 breaks and the mass \nfalls down. This is because of the tension \ndeveloped in the string 2 due to the mass.\nPressure : You must have observed the tyres of \ntwo wheelers and four wheelers getting \n‘Pressurized’. The  air filling machine has a \n‘pressure’ indicating dial or a digital meter \nshowing the digital reading of ‘pressure’. The \nmachine fills the ‘pressure’ to a certain value. \nYou are aware that a force has to be applied for \nfilling air in the bicycle tyre with a hand pump. \nBy applying force, air ‘pressure’ is increased \nand then the air is pushed into the tyre. Are \n‘force’ and ‘pressure’related?\nActivity 3 : Take some sharp pointed nails and \npush them into a wooden plank by hammering \non their heads. Now take a nail and hold it with \nits head on the plank and hammer it down from \nthe pointed end. When pressing the drawing pins \ninto a drawing board, they get into the board \neasily. By applying a force using the thumb one \ncan push the pins into the board. On the contrary, \nwhile pressing ordinary pins into the board with \na thumb, the thumb may get hurt.\n\nTry this\n\nAlways remember\n\n\n\n17\n\nPresently we are considering \nonly the force acting on an area in a \ndirection perpendicular to it.\n\nWhat does this simple experiment tell? The nail easily penetrates into wood from its \npointed end. From this you will notice that when a force is applied on the head of the nail, it \nis easy to hammer it into the plank.\n\n It is easy to cut vegetables, fruits with a sharp knife. A \nblunt knife does not work here. Why does this happen? \n\nThe force exerted perpendicularly on a unit area is called ‘pressure’\n\nUnit of pressure : The SI unit of force is Newton \n(N). Area is measured in m2. Therefore, the SI unit \nof pressure is N/m2. It is known as Pascal (Pa). In \natmospheric science, the unit for pressure is bar \n1 bar = 105 Pa.  Pressure is a scalar quantity.\n\n If area increases, pressure reduces for the same force, and if the area decreases, the \npressure increases for the same force.\n For example, due to natural adaptation the bottom surfaces of camel’s feet are broad. \nHence the camel’s weight is exerted on a large area and the pressure on the sand is reduced. \nThis is why camel’s feet do not penetrate into the sand and it becomes easy to walk.\nPressure on solids : Air pressure is exerted on all the objects kept in air. When a weight is \nkept on a solid, pressure is exerted on it. This pressure depends on the value of the weight and \nthe contact area between the two.\n\nDo the activity as depicted in fig 3.5. What is seen?\n\nYou must have seen a vegetable vendor \ncarrying a basket on her head. She keeps a \ntwisted piece of cloth on the head, below the \nbasket. How does it help?\n\nWe can not stand at one place for a long \ntime. How then can we sleep on a place for 8 \nand odd hours?\n\nFor skiing on ice, why are long flat ski \nused?\n\nPressure of liquid \n\nActivity 1 : Take a plastic bottle. Take a 10 cm long piece of a glass tube on which a rubber \nballoon can be fitted. Warm up one end of the glass tube and gently push in the bottle at about \n5 cm from the bottom (fig 3.6).  To avoid water leakage, apply molten wax on the side of the \nglass tube. Now fill water slowly in the bottle and see how the balloon inflates. What is \nobserved? The pressure of water acts on the side of the bottle as well. \n\nUse your brain power\n\nUse your brain power\n\nTry this\n\nTry this\n\nPressure =                        \n Force\n\n                  Area on which the force in applied\n\n3.5 Force and Pressure\n\n\n\n18\n3.8 Atmospheric Pressure\n\nActivity 2 : Take a plastic bottle. Pierce it \nwith a thick needle at the points 1,2,3 as \nshown in the fig. 3.7. Fill water in the \nbottle upto full height. As shown in the \nfigure, water jets will be seen emerging \nand projecting out. The water jet emerging \nfrom the hole at the top will fall closest to \nthe bottle. The jet from the lowest hole \nfalls farthest from the bottle. Also, jets \ncoming out from the two holes at the same \nlevel fall at the same distance from the \nbottle. What is understood from this? At \nany one level, the liquid pressure is the \nsame. Also, the pressure increases as the \ndepth of the liquid increases.\n\nGas pressure : If a balloon is inflated by filling air by mouth, it inflates on all sides. If a pin \nhole is created in the balloon, air leaks out and the balloon does not inflate fully. It is realized \nthat like a liquid, gas also exerts pressure on the wall of the container in which it is enclosed. \nAll gases and liquids have a common name ‘fluid’. Fluids in a container exert pressure from \nwithin, on the walls and the bottom of the container. A fluid enclosed in a containers exerts its \npressure equally in all directions at a point within the fluid.\nAtmospheric Pressure : Air surrounds the earth from all sides. This layer of air is called \natmosphere. The atomosphere exists to about 16 km height. It further extends up to about 400 \nkm in a very dilute form. The pressure created due to air is called the atmospheric pressure. \nImagine that a very long hollow cylinder of unit cross-sectional area is standing on the surface \nof the earth, and it contains air (fig.3.8). Weight of this air is the force applied in the direction \nof the centre of the earth. This means that atmospheric pressure is the ratio of this weight \ndivided by the area of the surface. \n\nThe air pressure at the sea level is called 1 Atomosphere pressure. Air pressure decreases \nas one goes up in height from the sea level.\n\n1 Atomosphere = 101 x 103 Pa = 1 bar = 103 mbar\n1 mbar »102 Pa (hecto pascal) \n\nAtmospheric pressure is specified in the units mbar or \nhectopascal (hPa). The atmospheric pressure at a point in air \nis equal from all sides. How is this pressure created? If air \nexists in a closed container, the air molecules in random \nmotion continuously hit the walls of the container. In this \ninteraction a force is exerted on the walls of the container. \nPressure is created due to this force.\n\nWe constantly bear the atmospheric pressure on our \nheads. However the cavities in our body are also filled with \nair and arteries and veins are filled with blood. Therefore we \ndo not get crushed under water and due to atmospheric \npressure, as the pressure is balanced. The earth’s atmospheric \npressure decreases with height from the sea level as shown in \nfig 3.9. \n\n3.6 Pressure of \n\nLiquid\n\n3.7 Level and \n\nPressure of Liquid\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n1 cm2\n\n\n\n19\n\n3.9 Atomospheric Pressure\n\nAt the sea level the atmospheric \npressure 101 x 103 Pa is acting on a \ntable top of size 1m2. Under such a \nheavy pressure, why doesn’t the table \ntop crumble down?\n\n3.10 Balanced and unbalanced Buoyant force\n\nThe empty plastic bottle floats on the surface of water. On the contrary, the bottle full of \nwater floats inside water but does not go to the bottom. The weight of the empty bottle is \nnegligible as compared with the weight of the water inside. Such a bottle with water neither \nfloats on the surface, nor does it go to the bottom. This means the force due to gravity acting \ndownwards (f\n\ng\n), must have been balanced by an opposing force in the upward direction (f\n\nb\n) on \n\nthe bottle filled with water. This force must have originated from the water surrounding the \nbottle. The upward force acting on the object in water or other fluid or gas is called Buoyant \nforce (f\n\nb\n).\n\n While pulling a bucket from a well, the bucket full of \nwater immersed fully in water appears to weigh less than \nwhen it has been pulled out of water. Why?\n\n Take a plastic bottle and fix the lid tightly. \nNow place it in water and see. It will float on \nwater. Try and push it into the water. Even when \npushed, it continues to float. This experiment can \nalso be done with a plastic hollow ball (fig 3.10) \n\nNow fill the bottle with water to the fullest \ncapacity and close the lid, and release in water. \nThe bottle will float inside the water. Why does \nthis happen? \n\nBuoyant Force : \n\n Take a piece of thin aluminium sheet and dip it in water in a bucket. \nWhat do you observe? Now shape the same piece of aluminium into a \nsmall boat and place it on the surface of water. If floats, isn’t it?\n\nAn iron nail sinks in water, but why does the massive steel ship float on it? When an \nobject is dipped in a liquid, a buoyant force acts on it and hence it appears that the weight of \nthe object is reduced.\n\nIt becomes easier to swim in sea water than in fresh water. This is because the density of \nsea water is higher than the density of fresh water, due to salts dissoved in sea water. In this \nbook you have seen that lemon sinks in a glass filled with water but it floats when we stir in \ntwo spoons of salt in the water. In salty water the buoyant force exceeds the gravitational  \nforce. What is understood from these examples? Buoyant force depends on two factors \n1. Volume of the object - The buoyant force is more if the volume of the dipping object is \n\nmore.\n2. Density of liquid - More the density of liquid, more is the force of buoyancy.\n\n2000\n\n100\n\n6000 10000\n\nA\ntm\n\nos\nph\n\ner\nic\n\n P\nre\n\nss\nuu\n\nre\n\nHeight (m)\n\nTry this\n\nTry this\n\nUse your brain power\n\nUse your brain power\n\nf\nb\n\nf\ng\n\n\n\n20\n\n3.11 Buoyant Force\n\nArchemedes \n(287 B.C - 212 B.C)\n\nIntroduction to the Scientist :\n\nArchemedes Principle :\n\nTake a long rubberband and cut it at one point. At one of its ends tie \na clean washed stone or a 50 g weight as shown in figure 3.11. \n\nNow hold the other end of the rubberband and \nmake a mark there. Keep the stone hanging in air \nand measure the length of the rubberband from the \nstone to the mark made earlier. Now take water in a \npot and hold the rubberband at such a height that the \nstone sinks in it. Again measure the length of the \nrubberband up to the mark. What is observed? This \nlength in shorter than the earlier length. While \ndipping the stone in water, length of the stretched \nrubber gets slowly reduced and is minimum when it \nsinks completely. What could be the reason for a \nshorter length of the rubberband in water?\n When the stone is sunk in water, a buoyant force acts on it in the upward direction. The \nweight of the stone acts downwards. Therefore, the force which acts on it in the downward \ndirection is effectively reduced.\n How much is the magnitude of the buoyant force? Is it the same for all the liquids? Is the \nbuoyant force of equal magnitude for all objects? The answers to these questions are embodied \nin Archemedes principle. This principle states that : When an object is partially or fully \nimmersed in a fluid, a force of buoyancy acts on it in the upward direction. This force is \nequal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.\n\nArchemedes was a Greek Scientist and a mathematician \nwith sharp intelligence. He found out the value of p by numerical \ncalculations. His knowledge of levers, pulleys, wheels in physics \nwas useful to the Greek army in fighting against the Roman army. \nHe became famous due to his work in geometry and mechanics. \nWhen he entered a bath tub for taking bath, he discovered the \nabove principle by observing the overflowing water. He came out \nin the same state shouting ‘eureka’, ‘eureka’, meaning ‘I found \nit’, ‘I found it.’\n\nExplain the obsevations in the earlier experiments according \nto the Archemedes Principle.\n\nThe use of Archemedes Principle is very wide. This principle has been used in the \nconstruction of ships and submarines. The instruments such as lactometer, hygrometer are \nbased on this principle. \n\nHow is it decided that in object left in liquid will get sink in the liquid, will float on the \nsurface, or will float inside the liquid?\n1. The object floats if the buoyant force is larger than its weight.\n2. The object sinks if the buoyant force is smaller than its weight.\n3. The object floats inside the liquid if the buoyant force is equal to its weight.\nWhich forces are unbalanced in the above cases ?\n\nDo you know?\n\nTry this\n\nUse your brain power\n\n\n\n21\n\nDensity of substance and Relative density \n\nDensity  = \n  Mass\n\nVolume\n  \n\nThe SI unit of density is kg/m3. The property density is very useful in deciding the purity \nof the substance. The relative density of a substance is expressed w.r.t. the density of water.\n\nRelative density  =  \nDensity of substance\nDensity of water\n\nthis being a ratio of two equal physical quantities it has no unit. Relative density of a substance \nis called its ‘specific gravity.’\n\nSolved examples\n\nExample 1.

Current Electricity and Magnetism\n\nWhich constituents are present in an atom ?\n\n4.1 (a) Electrical Circuit\n\n4.1 (b) Electrical Circuit\n\nAn atom has same number of postively charged protons and negatively charged electrons. \nSo an object doesn't show any charge though its atoms contain charged particles. Therefore, \nwe can say that plenty of electrical charge is filled in the objects around us. What will happen \nif a glass rod is rubbed on a silk cloth? How do objects get charges ? What are static and \nmoving charges ? Moving charges get transferred from one object to the other. These are \nnegatively charged. Moving negatively charged particle are the electrons. Can this negative \ncharge be made to flow? Can electricity be made to flow like water flowing from higher to \nlower level ? You have learnt that a force will have to be applied to put a stationary object \ninto motion. We get current electricity when the elctrons in an electrical conductor are made \nto flow.\nCurrent Electricity : A large current flows when lightning takes place from a cloud to the \nground, while sensation is felt by us due to a microscopically small current flowing to the \nbrain. You are aware of the current flowing through wires, electric bulbs, and equipments in \nthe house. In the electric cells of a radio or in a car battery, a current is produced by the flow \nof both negatively and positively charged particles.\nElectrostatic Potential : Water or a liquid flows from a higher level to a lower level. Heat \nalways flows from a body at higher temperature to a body at lower temperature. Similarly, \nthere is a tendency of the positive charge to flow from a point of higher electric level to a point \nof lower electric level. This electric level deciding the direction of flow of electric charges is \ncalled electrostatic potential.\nPotential difference : Similar to the height of a waterfall, the temperature difference of hot \nand cold bodies, the difference between the potential of two points, i.e. potential difference is \ninteresting to us.\n\nTake connecting copper wires and connect the \n‘circuit’ as shown in fig 4.1 (a). No current is seen to \nflow in the bulb. Now connect in the same ‘circuit’ \na 1.5 V dry cell available in the market as shown \nin fig 4.1 (b). Now it will be realized from glowing \nof the bulb that a current is flowing in the circuit. \nElectrons in the wire flow due to the potential \ndifference between the two ends of the dry cell. \nThese flow from the negative terminal of the cell \nto the positive terminal of the cell. Conventional \ncurrent flows in the opposite  direction and is shown \nin the figure by the sign of an arrow. We will learn \nabout an electrical circuit later in this chapter.\n\nIn fig 4.1 (a), there is no current as there is \nno potential difference in the absence of any cell. \nCurrent starts flowing  in the circuit as soon as the \npotential difference is applied. The unit of potential \ndifference in SI system is Volt (V). We will learn \nabout it in the next standard.\n\nCan you recall?\n\nTry this\n\n\n\n24\n\nHow can we measure water flow emerging from a pipe? \nWe can find it from the amount of water (litres) coming out in a \nspecific time period. How then is the electric current measured?\n\nTake a lead dry cell and remove its outer \ncoating. Inside you will find a whitish, metal \nlayer. This is the Zinc (Zn) metal layer. This is \nthe negative terminal of the cell. Now, carefully \nbreak open this layer. There is another layer \ninside. An electrolyte is filled between these \ntwo layers. The elctrolyte contains negatively \ncharged and positively charged ions. These \nare the carriers of electricity. The electrolyte \nis a wet pulp of Zinc chloride (ZnCl\n\n2\n) and \n\nAmmonium chloride (NH\n4\nCl). There is a \n\ngraphite rod at the centre of the cell. This \nis positive terminal of the cell. A paste of \nManganese dioxide (MnO\n\n2\n) is filled outside \n\nthe rod. Because of the chemical reactions \nof all these chemicals, electrical charge is \nproduced on the two terminals (graphite rod \nand zinc layer) and an electric current flows \nin the circuit.\n\n4.2 Dry cell\n\nWe have seen that electric current is produced due to the flow of charged particles. \nElectrical  charge flowing through a wire in 1 second can be called unit current. The SI unit \nof electric current is Coulomb per second or Ampere.\n\n1 Ampere = 1A = 1 Coulomb/1 second = 1 C/s. Electric current is a scalar quantity.\nElectric cell : A source is required to produce a uniform flow of charges in a circuit. Such a \ngeneral device is an electric cell. Various types of electric cells are available today. These \nare used in a range of machines from wrist watches to submarines. Out of these, you must \nbe aware of solar cells. The main function of various electric cells is to maintain a constant \npotential difference between its two terminals. The electric cells work on the electric charges \nto maintain a constant potential difference, about which you will learn later. Let us learn \nabout the electic cells that are currently in use.\nDry Cell : The dry cells are used in our radio sets, wall clocks and torches. These are available \nin 3-4  sizes. The construction of a dry cell is as shown in fig. 4.2.\n\nDue to the wet pulp used in this cell, the chemical reaction proceeds very slowly. Hence \na large electric current can not be obtained from this. Compared to the electric cells using \nliquids, the shelf life of dry cells is longer. Dry cells are very convenient to use as these can be \nheld in any direction with respect to ground and can be used in mobile instruments.\n\nPositive terminal\n\nnegative terminal\n\nProtecttive \ncover\n\nManganese \ndioxide \n\nZinc cover\n\nDivisor\n\nCarbon \nelectrode elcectrolyte\n\nThink about it.\n\nTry this\n\n\n\n25\n\nLead-Acid Cell : Figure 4.3 depicts the \ndesign of a Lead-Acid cell. Let us examine its \nprinciple. This type of cell can be recharged \nafter getting electrically discharged. The lead-\nacid  cell contains a lead electrode and a lead \noxide electrode and both are dipped in dilute \nsulfuric acid. PbO\n\n2\n carries a positive charge, \n\nwhile the Pb electrode carries a negative \ncharge. The potential difference between these \ntwo is nearly 2V. Because of the chemical \nreaction between the substances in the cell, \nelectrical charge is produced on both the \nelectrodes and electric current flows through \nthe load (e.g. bulb) in the cicuit.\n\nLithium ion cells \nare used in modern \nequipments for exam-\nple smart phone, laptop \netc. These cells can be \nrecharged. More elec-\ntrical energy can be \nstored in these cells as \ncompared to that in Ni-\ncd cells.\n\nThis kind of electric cells have a capacity to deliver \nlarge current. Hence lead-acid cells are used in cars, trucks, \nmotorcycles and uninterrupted power supplies (UPS). \nNi-Cd cell : These days, a variety of gadgets are available, \nwhich are required to be carried to different places. Such \ngadgets use Ni-Cd cells. The cells deliver 1.2 V potential \ndifference and are rechargeble.\nElectric Circuit : When a cell holder, an electric bulb and \na plug key are connected by connecting wires, as shown \nin fig. 4.4 (b) and a dry cell is fitted in the holder (fig \n4.4 (a)), then the bulb lights up by closing the plug key.  \nThis means that a current flows through the circuit and \nbulb lights up. On the removal of the cell, the electric \ncurrent flowing through the circuit stops as indicated by \nthe bulb which ceases to glow. This type of connection \nof electrical components is called an electrical circuit. A \ncircuit is shown in fig 4.4. (b) The cell is shown by the \nsymbol.  .\n\n4.4 (b) Simple electric circuit\n\nCell\n\nPlug key\n\nElectric bulb\n\n4.4 (a) Cell holder\n\n4.3 Lead-Acid Cell\n\nPositive terminal negative terminal\n\nLead \ndioxide\n\nLead\n\nElectrolyte\n\nAn electrical ciruit is also used in the home supply. However, \nthe electricity supply is made from outside, instead of the electric \ncells. You will learn about it later. \nConnecting cells : You must have seen more than one electric \ncells connected in an electrical circuit (see figure 4.5 (a)). In the \ntransister radio, 2-3 dry cell are seen to be connected in series. \nThe purpose of doing this is to obtain more potential difference \nthan that of a single cell. Therefore, it is possible to obtain higher \ncurrent. If the cells are connected as seen in fig 4.5 (b), the \nconnection of cells is known as a Battery of cells.\nIn this series connection, the postive terminal of one cell is \nconnected to the negative terminal of second cell and the positive \nterminal of the second cell is connected to the negative terminal \nof the third one. Therefore, if each cell has a potential difference \nof 1V the total potential difference of 3 cells will be 3V.\n\nResearch\n\n\n\n26\n\nYou must have seen the car battery available in the \nmarket. It is called a battery and not a cell. Why?\n\nMagnetic effects of electric current :  \nActivity 1. Take the inside tray of an used up \n\nmatch box place a small magnetic needle inside the \ntray. Now take a long connecting wire and wind \nit around the tray. Complete the electric circuit by \nconnecting in it, this wire, electric cell, plug key and a \nbulb (fig. 4.6) \n\nMark the position of the magnetic needle. Take a \nbar magnet near to the magnetic needle. What do you \nobserve ? keep looking at the needle and close the plug \nkey. The bulb will light up, and you will realize that the \ncurrent has started flowing. Does the magnetic needle \nchange its position ? Now open the plug key. Does the \nmagnetic needle come back to the original position ? \nWhat will you conclude from this experiment?\n\n4.5 Connecting cells\n(b)(a)\n\n4.6 Magnetic effect of current\n\n(.)\n\nUse your brain power\n\nTry this\n\nYou know that a magnetic needle is indeed a magnet. You have seen that the magnetic \nneedle changes its direction when a bar magnet is taken near the magnetic needle. Also, you \nhave observed that the magnetic needle changes its direction when a current starts flowing in \nthe circuit. This means that  magnetic field is created when an electric current flows in a wire. \nHans Christian Oerstead made this observation first. Briefly we can say that when an electric \ncurrent passes through  a wire, a magnetic field in produced around that wire.\n\nActivity 2 : Take a meter long flexible copper wire \nhaving resistive coating and wind tightly on a long iron \nscrew. Connect the two ends of the wire in a circuit as \nshown in the figure 4.7. Also connect an electric cell \nand a plug key in the circuit. Keep 2-4 iron pins/small \nnails near the screw. Now start the current in the circuit \nby plugging the key. It will be noticed that the pins/nails \nhave stuck to the tip of the screw. Will the pins/nails \ncontinue to stick when the plug key is opened?\n\nWhen the electic current flows in the wire, magnetism is produced in the coil around the \nscrew and because of that the screw also attains magetism. As soon as the current is stopped, \nthis magnetism vanishes. The system of coil and the screw is called an electromagnet. You \nhave seen various uses of the electromagnet in the sixth standard. Electromagnets are used to \nproduce strong magnetic field useful in scientific research.\n\n4.7 Electro magnet\n\n(.\n)\n\nFlow of electrons\n\nElectrical resistance/Load\n\n(+) (+)\n\n(+) (-)\n\n(-) (-)\n\n\n\n27\n\nElectric Bell : Many of you must have seen the simple \nelectric door bell. Open such a bell which is out of order. \nFig 4.8 depicts a bell with its outer cover removed. We \nsee that there is an electromagnet inside. Let us understand \nthe working of the bell. A copper wire is wound around \nan iron piece. This coil acts as an electromagnet. An iron \nstrip along with a striker is fitted near to the electromagnet. \nA contact screw is in touch with the strip. The electric \ncircuit is connected as shown in fig 4.8. The current flows \nin the circuit when screw is in contact with the strip, and \nhence the coil becomes a magnet and attracts the iron strip \ntowards it. Therefore, the striker hits the gong and the \nsound is created. However, at the same time, the contact \nscrew loses the contact with the strip and the current in \nthe circuit stops. In this situation, the electromagnet loses \nits magnetism and the iron strip moves back and comes in \ncontact with the contact screw. The electric current is then \nimmediately restored and again the striker hits the gong by \nthe above process. This action repeats itself and the bell \nrings.\n\n1.

What is meant by matter  ?  2. What is an atom ?\n3. What is the smallest unit of matter ?\n\n5. Inside the Atom\n\n· Indian philosopher Kanad (6th century B.C.) stated that there is a limit to divide matter \ninto small particles. The indivisible particles that constitute matter were named by Kanad \nMuni as ‘Paramanu’ (meaning the smallest particles). He also stated that ‘Paramanu’ \nis indistructible.\n\n· Greek philosopher Democritus (5th century B.C.) stated that matter is made of small \nparticles and these cannot be divide. The smallest particle of matter was name by \nDemocritus as ‘Atom’. (In Greek language ‘Atomos’ means the one which cannot be cut.)\n\nWe have seen that matter is made of molecules. Molecules are formed from atoms. \nEffectively an atom is the smallest unit of matter. An atom is the smallest particle of an \nelement which retains its chemical identity in all the physical and chemical changes. \n\nThe table 5.1 shows names and formulae of some substances. Complete the table by \nputting tick marks in appropriate box to indicate the information of the smallest particle and \nthe type of matter.\n\nName of \nsubstance\n\nFormula\n\nSmallest particle of the substance Type of matter\n\nis an \natom\n\nis a \nmolecule\n\nsingle type \nof atoms in \n\nthe molecule\n\ndifferent types \nof atoms in the \n\nmolecule\nElement Compound\n\nWater H\n2\nO ü ü ü\n\nOxygen O\n2 ü ü ü\n\nHelium He ü ü ü\nHydrogen H\n\n2\n\nAmmonia NH\n3\n\nNitrogen N\n2\n\nMethane CH\n4\n\nArgon Ar\n\nNeon Ne\n\nChlorine Cl\n2\n\n5.1 Types of substances\nWe have learnt in the earlier standard that the smallest particles of most of the substances \n\nare molecules. The molecules of a few substances contain only one atom. Molecules are \nformed by chemical of combination of atoms. From this we understand that the smallest \nparticle of an element taking part in chemical combination is an atom. The concept of atom \nis more than 2500 years old. However, it was forgotten in the course of time. In the modern \ntimes, scientists on the basis of experiments explained the nature of atom as well as the internal \nstructure of atom. It started with Dalton’s atomic theory. \n\nCan you recall?\n\nDo you know?\n\n\n\n29\n\nDalton’s atomic theory : British scientist \nJohn Dalton put forth in 1803 A.D. his \ncelebrated ‘Atomic Theory’. According to \nthis theory matter is made of atoms and \natoms are indivisible and indestructible. All \natom of an element are alike while different \nelement have different atom with different \nmass. \n\nDalton's atomic modelJohn Dalton\n\n1. Take a solid ball and a ‘Bundi Laddu.’ Press both these spheres with \nyour palms. What did you find ? \n\n2. Cut the solid ball with a sharp knife. What did you find? \n\nThomson’s plum pudding model of atom \nThe plum pudding model of atom put \n\nforth by Thomson in the year 1904 is the \nfirst model of atomic structure. According to \nthis model the positive charge is distributed \nthroughout the atom and the negatively \ncharged electron are embedded in it. The \ndistributed positive charge is balanced by the \nnegative charge on the electrons. Therefore \nthe atom becomes electrically neutral.\n\nA ‘Bundi Laddu’ is found to have an \ninternal structure. It is formed by sticking \nsmaller particles, the ‘Bundis’ to each other. \nHowever, the solid ball, broadly speaking, \ndoes not have any internal structure. The \natom, as described by Dalton, turns out to be \na hard, solid sphere with no internal structure. \nAccording to Daltons atomic theory the \nmass is distributed uniformly in an atom. \nThe scientist J.J. Thomson demonstrated \nexperimentally that the negatively charged \nparticles inside an atom have a mass 1800 \ntimes less than a hydrogen atom. Later these \nparticles were named as electron. Common \nsubstances are usally electrically neutral. \nObviously the molecules of substances and \nthe atom which combine chemically to form \nmolecules are electrically neutral.\n\nHow is an atom electrically neutral in \nspite of having negatively charged electrons \nin it ? Thomson overcame this difficulty by \nputting forth the plum pudding model of \natomic structure.\n\nPlum pudding or plum cake is sweetdish prepared during Christmas. In old times, this \ndish was made in Western countries by adding pieces of dried fruit called plum. These days, \nraisins or dates are used.\n\n5.3 Thomson's plum pudding model of atom\n\nJ.J.

If the striker hits the coin, in which direction would it go? Straight \nforward to a side or in the reverse direction?\n\nTry this\n\nDo you know?\n\nCan you tell?\n\nHow will you think about atomic mass \ndistribution according to Thomson's model? \nWhether this distribution is uniform or non \nuniform as per Dalton's atomic theory ? \n\nUse your brain power\n\n\n\n30\n\n5.4 Rutherford’s scatterring experiment\n\n5.5 Rutherford’s Nuclear atomic model\n\nGolden foil\n\na - Particle emitter\n\nSlit Fluoroscent screen\n\nRutherford’s atomic model\n\nThe large number of the a - particles \nthat went straight through the foil indicates \nthat there was no obstacle in their path. It \nmeant that there must be mainly an empty \nspace inside the atoms in the solid gold foil. \nThe small number of a - particles that get \ndeflected through a small or a big angle must \nhave faced an obstacle in their path. It meant \nthat the positively charged and heavy part \ncausing obstruction would be in the centre of \nthe atom. From this Rutherford put forth a \nnuclear model for atom as follows :\n\n1. There is a positively charged nucleus at \ncentre of an atom. 2. Almost the entire mass \nof the atom is concentrated in the nucleus. \n3. Negatively charged particles called \nelectrons revolve around the nucleus. 4. The \ntotal negative charged on all the electron is \nequal to the positive charge on the nucleus. \nAs the opposite charges are balanced the \natom is electrically neutral. 5. There is an \nempty space between the revolving electron \nand the atomic nucleus.\n\n1. Which discovery did point out that an \natom has internal structure? \n\n2. What is the difference between the solid \natom in Dalton’s atomic theory and \nThomson’s atomic model? \n\n3. Explain the difference between \nthe distribution of positive charge \nin Thomson’s atomic model and \nRutherford’s atomic model. \n\n4. What is the point difference between the \nplace of electron in the atomic models of \nThomson and Rutherford? \n\n5. What is the thing which is present in \nRutherford’s atomic model and not \npresent in Dalton’s and Thomson’s \natomic models?\n\nAn established law of physics an \nelectrically charged body is revolving in a \ncircular orbit, its energy decreases. According \nto this law the atom described in Rutherford’s \nmodel turns out to be unstable. In reality, \nhowever all atom, except radioactive atom, \nare stable. This shortcoming of Rutherford’s \natomic model was removed by the atomic \nmodel put forth by Niels Bohr in the year \n1913. \nBohr’s  stable orbit atomic model (1913)\n\nIn the year 1913 Danish scientist Niels \nBohr explained the stability of atom by \nputting forth stable orbit atomic model. The \nimportant postulates of Bohr’s atomic model \nare as follows. \n(i) The electrons revolving around the \n\natomic nucleus lie in the concentric \ncircular orbits at certain distance from \nthe nucleus.\n\nUse your brain power\n\nRutherford’s nuclear model of atom (1911) \nRutherford studied the inside of atom by \n\nhis celebrated scatterring experiment and put \nforth the nuclear model of atom in the year \n1911. \n\nRutherford took a very thin gold foil \n(thickness : 10-4mm) and bombarded it with \npositively charged  a - particles emitted by a \nradioactive element. (fig. 5.4) He observed \nthe path of  a - particles by means of a \nfluorescent screen around the gold foil. It \nwas expected that the a- particles would get \nreflected from the gold foil if the positively \ncharged mass were evenly distributed inside \nthe atoms. Unexpectedly, most of the a - \nparticles went straight through the foil, a \nsmall number of a - particles get deflected \nfrom the original path through a small \nangle, a still smaller number of  a- particles \nget deflected throught a larger angle and \nsusprisingly one a - particle out of 20000 \nbounced back in the direction opposite to the \noriginal path. \n\n\n\n31\n\n(ii) Energy of an electron is constant while it \nis in a particular orbit. \n\n(iii) When an electron jumps from an inner \norbit to an outer orbit it absorbs energy \nequal to the difference of its energy level \nand when it jumps from an outer orbit to \nan inner orbit it emits energy equal to the \ndifference of its energy level.\n\n5.6 Bohr's stable orbit atomic model\n\nWhen table salt (Sodium chloride) \nis thrown on LPG gas stove flame, \nimmediatly yellow spark forms on that \nplace. If sodium metal put in water, \nit burns to give yellow flame. On road \nsodium vapour lamp gives yellow \ncolour light. From all above example, \nthe electron of sodium absorb energy \nand goes to outermost shell and come \nback to inner shell by emitting energy. \nThe difference of energy level of these \ntwo shells of sodium is fixed. This \ndifference is similar to energy of yellow \nlight. Therefore in above example same \nspecific yellow light emitted.  \n\nN Shell\nM Shell\n\nL Shell\nK Shell\nPositively\ncharged\nnucleus\n\nSome more atomic models were put \nforth after Bohr’s atomic model. Atomic \nstructure was studied at depth with the \nadvent of a new branch of science called \nquantum mechanics. With all those some \nwell accepted fundamental principles of \natomic structure are as follows :\n\nAtomic structure \nAn atom is formed from the nucleus and \n\nthe extranuclear part. These contain three \ntypes of subatomic particles.\nNucleus \n\nThe atomic nucleus is positively \ncharged. Almost entire mass of the atom \nis concentrated in the nucleus. The nucleus \ncontains two types of subatomic particles \ntogether called nucleons. Protons and \nneutrons are the two types of nucleons.\nProton (p) \n\nProton is a positively charged subatomic \nparticle in the atomic nucleus. The positive \ncharge on the nucleus is due to the proton \nin it. A proton is represented by the symbol \n‘p’. Each  proton carries a positive charge of \n+1e. (1e = 1.6 ´ 10-19 coulomb). When total \npositive charge on the nucleus is expressed \nin the unit ‘e’ , its magnitude is equal to \nthe number of proton in the nucleus. The \nnumber of protons in the nucleus of an atom \nis the atomic number of that element and is \ndenoted by the  ‘Z’ mass of one proton is \napproximately 1u (1 Dalton) \n(1u = 1.66 ´ 10-27 Kg) (The mass of one \nhydrogen atom is also approximately 1 u.)\nNeutron (n) \n\nNeutron is an electrically neutral \nsubatomic particle and is denoted by the \nsymbol ‘n’. The number of neutron in the \nnucleus is denoted by the symbol ‘N’. Atomic \nnuclei of all the elements except hydrogen \nwith atomic mass 1u, contain neutrons. The \nmass of a neutron is approximately 1 u, \nwhich is almost equal to that of a proton.\nExtranuclear part \n\nThe extranuclear part in the atomic \nstructure includes electrons revolving around \nthe nucleus and the empty space in between \nthe nucleus and the electron.\n\nDo you know?\n\n\n\n32\n\nElectron  (e-)  \nElectron is a negatively charged \n\nsubatomic particle and is denoted by the \nsymbol ‘e-’. Each  electron carries one unit \nof negative charge (-1e). Mass of an electron \nis 1800 times less than that of a hydrogen \natom. Therefore the mass of an electron can \nbe treated as negligible. \n\nElectron in the extranuclear part revolve \nin the discrete orbits around the nucleus. The \norbits being three dimensional in nature, a \nterm ‘shell’ is used in stead of the term ‘orbit’. \nThe energy of an elctron is determined by the \nshell in which it is present. \n\nThe number of electron in the \nextranuclear part is equal to the number \nof proton in the nucleus (Z). Therefore \nelectrical charges are balanced and the atom \nis electrically neutral.\n\n1. How many types of subatomic particles \nare found in atom? \n\n2. Which subatomic particles are electrically \ncharged? \n\n3. Which subatomic particles are present in \nthe nucleus? \n\n4. Where are electrons revolving around the \nnucleus placed? \n\nThe mass of an electron being negligible, \ntherefore the mass of an atom is mainly due \nto the protons and neutrons in its nucleus. \nThe total number of protons and neutron in \nan atom is the atomic mass number of that \nelement. The mass number is denoted by \nthe symbol  ‘A’. The convention to denote \natomic symbol, atomic number and mass \nnumber are together is shown as follows.\n\n  A \n  Z\n\nsymbol. For example, the conventional \nsymbol 12\n\n  6\nC  means that the atomic number, \n\nthat is, the proton number of carbon is 6 and \nthe mass number of carbon is 12. From this \nit is also learnt that the nucleus of carbon \ncontain (12-6) i.e. 6 neutrons.\n\n1. The symbol used for oxygen is ‘O’. There \nare 8 protons and 8 neutrons in its nucleus. \nFrom this determine the atomic number \n(Z) and mass number  (A) of oxygen and \narrange these in a conventional symbol. \n\n2. Atomic number of carbon is 6. How many \nelectrons are there in a carbon  atom ? \n\n3. A sodium atom contains 11 electrons. \nWhat is the atomic number of sodium ?\n\n4. The atomic number and mass number of \nmagnesium are 12 and 24 respectively. \nHow will you show this by the convention \nsymbol ?\n\n5. The atomic number and mass number \nof calcium are 20 and 40 respectively. \nDeduce the number of neutron present in \nthe calcium nucleus. \n\nDistribution of electron :  As per Bohr’s \natomic model, electrons revolve in stable \nshells. These shells have a definite energy. \nThe shell nearest to the nucleus is called the  \nfirst shell. The next shell is called the second \nshell.  A symbol ‘n’ is used for the ordinal \nnumber of a shell. The shells are referred to \nby the symbols K, L, M, N,.... corresponding \nto the ordinal numbers n = 1, 2, 3, 4, ... The \nmaximum number of electron a shell can \ncontain is obtained by the formula ‘2n2’.  As \nthe magnitude of  ‘n’ increases, the energy of \nan electron in that shell increases.\n\nShell Electron capacity of the shell\n\nSymbol n Formula : 2 n2 Number of \nElectrons\n\nK 1 2 ´ (1)2\n\nL\n\nM\n\nN\n\nWrite the maximum number of electron in \na shell using the above table.

There is a similarity in the atomic structure and solar system. \nThe planets revolve around the sun due to the gravitational force. \nWhich force might be acting in the atomic structure ?\n\n2. Positively charged proton are together in the nucleus. What \nmight be, one of the function of the neutrons in the nucleus ?\n\nElectronic configuration of elements : \nWe have seen that  2, 8, 18, 32.... electrons \ncan be  accommodated in the shells K, L, \nM, N .... respectively. This is the maximum \ncapacity of that shells. The electrons in an \natom are distributed in the shells according \nto their maximum capacity. The shellwise \ndistribution of the electron in an atom of an \nelement is called the electronic configuration \nof that element.  Each electron has a definite \nenergy as per the shell in which it is present. \nEnergy of an electron in the first shell  (K \nshell) is the lowest. Energy of electron in the \n\nsubsequent shells goes on increasing with the \nordinal number of the shell. The electronic \nconfiguration of an element is such that the \nenergy of all the electrons together is the \nmaximum possible. Electrons get a place in \nthe shells in accordance with the maximum \ncapacity of the electron shell in an atom and \nthe increasing order of energy. Let us now \nlook at the electronic configuration of atom \nof some elements.  (Table 5.7). The rows 1 \nto 3 are filled in this table.

Here the numbers indicate the electron number in the shells with increasing order of \nenergy for example the electronic configuration of sodium is 2, 8, 1. It means that the total 11 \nelectrons in sodium are distributed as 2 in the shell ‘K’, 8 in the shell ‘L’, and 1 in the shell \n‘M’. The electronic configuration of an atom can also be represented by shell diagram as \nshown in fig 5.8 \nValency and electronic configuaration : We have seen in the last chapter that valency means \nthe number of chemical bonds formed by an atom. We also saw that generally the valency of \nan element remain constant in  its compounds.\n\nCan you tell?\n\n\n\n34\n\n5.8 Skeleton of Electronic configuration\n\nUse the following molecular \nformulae to determine the valencies \nof  H, Cl, O, S, N, C, Br, I, Na \n\nMolecular formulae  - H\n2\n, \n\nHCl, H\n2\nO, H\n\n2\nS, NH\n\n3\n, CH\n\n4\n HBr, HI, \n\nNaH .\n\n1. What are the symbols used for the shells \nwhich accommodate the electrons in \nvarious atoms? \n\n2. What is the symbol and ordinal number of \nthe inner most shell ?\n\n3.Write symbol of electron distribution in \nshell of fluorine atom?\n\n4. Which is the outermost shell of fluorine \natom ?\n\n5. Which is the outermost shell of sodium \natom ?\n\n6. Which is the outermost shell of hydrogen \natom ?\n\nThe concepts regarding valency of an \nelement chemical bonds in compounds get \nclarified from the electronic configuration. \nAtom forms chemical bonds by using \nelectron of its outermost shell. Valency of an \natom is determined by the configuration of \nits outermost shell. Therefore the outermost \nshell is called valence shell. Also, the \nelectrons in the outermost shell are called \nvalence electrons.\n\nIt can be seen that the valency of an \natom is related to the number of valence \nelectrons in that atom. Let us first look at \nthe elements helium and neon. Atoms of \nboth these gaseous element do not combine \nwith any other atom. These elements are \nchemically inert. It means that their valency \nis ‘Zero’. \n\nHelium atom contains two electrons \nwhich are accommodated in the first shell \n‘K’.\n\n (See the table 5.7) Helium has only one \n‘K’ shell that contains electron and the same \nis also the outermost shell. The electron \ncapacity (2n2) of ‘K’  shell is ‘two’. This \nindicates that the outermost shell of helium is \ncompletely filled. It is said that helium has an \nelectron duplet. The electronic configuration \nof the inert gas neon contain two shell ‘K’ \nand  ‘L’. ‘L’ is valence shell of neon. The \nelectron capacity of  ‘L’ shell is ‘eight’ and \nthe table 5.7 shows that the valence shell of \nneon is completely filled. It is said that neon \nhas an electron octet. Argon is an inert gas \nhaving electron in the shells ‘K’, ‘L’ and \n‘M’. The electron capacity of the ‘M’ shell is \n2 x 32 = 18. However in argon there are only \n8 electron in the valence shell ‘M’. (See table \n5.7) It means that there are eight electron in \nthe valence shell of inert gases, that is an \nelectron octet. From this it is understood that \nthe valency is ‘Zero’ when electron octet (or \nduplet) is complete. \n\nThe electronic configurations of \nelements other than inert gases (table 5.7) \nshow that they do not have electron octet \nor their electron octet are incomplete. \nRegarding hydrogen, it can be said that its \nelectron duplet is incomplete.\n\nUse your brain power\n\nCan you recall?\n\nHelium Carbon\n\nNeon\n\nHydrogen\n\nSodium\n\nHe\n\n\n\n35\n\nof sodium is also ‘one’ as seen from the \nmolecular formulae NaCl, NaH, etc. It \nmeans that there is some relation between \nthe valency of an element and the number of \nelectron in its valence shell. \n\nSr. \nNo.\n\nSymbol of \nelement \n\nMolecular \nformula of \ncompound \n\nValency \nof the \n\nelement \n\nElectronic \nconfiguration of \n\nthe element \n\nNumber \nof valence \nelectrons x\n\n8 - x \n(For x ³ 4)\n\n1 H HCl 1 1 1 --------\n\n2 Cl HCl 1 2, 8, 7 7 8-7 = 1\n\n3 Ne No compound 0\n\n4 F HF\n\n5 Na NaH\n\n6 Mg MgCl\n2\n\n7 C CH\n4\n\n8 Al AlCl\n3\n\n5.9 Relationship between valency and electronic configuration\n\nAtom of all the elements except inert \ngases have tendency to combine with other \natoms, meaning that they have a non zero \nvalency. You have seen from the formulae \nof the molecules formed by combination \nwith hydrogen (for example H\n\n2\n, HCl) that \n\nvalency of hydrogen is ‘one’. The electronic \nconfiguration of hydrogen shows that there is \n‘one’ electron less than the complete duplet \nstate.\n\nThis number ‘one’ matches with the \nvalency of hydrogen which is also ‘one’. \nMoreover it is learnt that the electronic \nconfiguration of sodium (2, 8, 1) has ‘one’ \nelectron in the valence shell and the valency \n\nThe following table (5.9) shows \nmolecular formulae of compounds formed \nby some elements. Write the valency of \nthe respective element obtained from them \nand also their electronic configuration and \nthe number of their valence electrons in the \nempty spaces. \n\n‘‘Valency of an element is \nsame as the number of its valence \nelectrons if this number is four or \nless than four.

Some elements in nature have atoms with same atomic number but different mass \nnumber. Such atom of the same element having different mass number are called isotopes. \nFor example, carbon has three isotopes, namely, C - 12, C - 13, C - 14.

They are used in various \nfields such as industry, agriculture, medicine, research field.\n1. Uranium - 235 is used for nuclear fission and production of electricity.\n2. Some radioactive isotopes like Cobalt - 60 are used in the medical treatment of fatal \n\ndiseases like cancer.\n3. Iodine -131 is used in the treatment of goiter, disease of thyroid gland.\n4. The radioactive isotopes are used for detection of cracks (leakage) in the underground \n\npipes. eg. Sodium -24.\n5. Radioactive isotopes are used for food preservation from microbes.\n6. The radioactive isotope C-14 is used for determining the age of archeological objects.\n\nNuclear Reactor :  Nuclear reactor is \na machine that generates electricity on \nlarge scale by using atomic energy (See \nfig. 5.10). In a nuclear reactor, the nuclear \nenergy in atom is released by bringing about \nnuclear reactions on the nuclear fuel. Let us \nunderstand a nuclear reaction with example \nof a nuclear fuel, namely, Uranium - 235. On \nbombardment with slow speed of neutrons, \nthe  nucleus of the isotope Uranium - 235 \nundergoes nuclear fission to form nuclei \nof two different elements Krypton - 92 \nand Barium - 141 and 2 to 3 neutrons. On \ndecreasing the speed these neutrons bring \nabout fission of more U-235 nuclei. In this \nway a chain reaction of nuclear fission takes \nplace. (See the figure 5.11) A large amount \nof nuclear energy is released during a chain \nreaction of fission. The chain reaction is \nkept under control to prevent the probable \nexplosion.  \n\nTo control the chain reaction in the \nnuclear reactor it is necessary to decrease \nthe speed and number of neutrons. For this \npurpose the following provision is made in a \nnuclear reactor. 5.11 Uranium - 235 Disintegration\n\n1. Moderator : Graphite or heavy water is used as moderator for reducing the speed of \nneutrons.\n2. Controller : To reduce the number of neutron by absorbing them rods of boron, cadmium, \nberyllium etc. are used as controller.\n\nThe heat produced in the fission process is taken out by using water as coolent.

What are the types of matter ?\n\n1. Classify the following matter into three groups. Cold drink, air, \nsherbat, soil, water, wood, cement. \n\n2. What are the states of matter that you used as criteria for the \nabove classification ?\n\nTake some mustard seeds in a transparent plastic jar. Thread a long \nthread at the centre of a big ballon by means of a needle and tie it tight. \n\nWe saw in the previous standards that all the objects that we see around us and also those \nwhich cannot be seen are made of same or the other matter.\n\nMode of pulling the \ndiaphragm up and down\n\nMovement of the \nmustard seeds \n\nSlow\nVibration in the \n\nsame place\n\nwith moderate force ......\n\nvigorous ......\n\n6.2 Physical state of matter : \n\nsubmicroscopic picture\n\nStretch this rubber diaphragm and fix it on the mouth of the jar by means of a rubber band. \nPull the diagphragm up and down with the help of the thread first slowly, then with moderate \nforce and then vigorously. Record your observation in the following table.\n\nMustard \nseeds\n\nPull thread \nslowly, \nmoderately, \nvigorously\n\nBig ballon\n\n6.1 Movement of mustard seeds\n\nVery less\n\nMedium\n\nLarge\n\nSolid\n\nLiquid\n\nGas\n\nInter Particle distance\n\nCan you recall?\n\nCan you tell?\n\nTry this\n\nOn the above experiment we give energy, \nless or more, to the mustard seeds by pulling the \ndiaphragm up and down, making them move \ndifferently. The particles in the solid, liquid and \ngaseous states of matter have movement some \nwhat similar to that.\n\nAn intermolecular force of attraction acts \nbetween the particles (atom or molecules) of \nmatter. The extent of the particle movement is \ndetermined by the strength of this force. The \nparticles of solid are very close to each other and \nvibrate at their fixed positions. Due to this, solids \nget properties like definite shape and volume \nand also high density and non-compressibility. \nThe strength of intermolecular force is moderate \nin the liquid state. Though it is not strong enough \nto fix the particles in definite position, it is strong \nenough to hold them together. As a result, liquids \nhave definite volume. However they have fludity \nand their shape is not definite but changes in \naccordance with the container.

In this method the \ncriterion used for classification of matter is \nchemical composition of matter. We have \nseen in the previous standard that matter is \nclassified into three types ‘element’, \n‘compound’ and ‘mixture’ by considering \nwhether the smallest particles of matter are \nsimilar or different and what are they made \nof. All the smallest particles (atoms/\nmolecules) in an element or a compound are \nalike, however, the smallest particles in a \nmixture are of two or more types.\n\nThe smallest particles of an element \ncontain identical atoms. For example, each \nmolecule of oxygen contains two oxygen \natoms in bonded state. The smallest particles \n(molecules) of a compound are formed by \njoining two or more types of atoms to each \n\nother. For example, each molecule of water \ncontain two hydrogen atoms joined to one \natom of oxygen. The smallest particles of a \nmixture are atoms/molecules of two or more \nelements/compounds. For example, the main \nconstituent molecules of the mixture namely, \nair are N\n\n2\n, O\n\n2\n, Ar,  H\n\n2\nO, CO\n\n2\n. Similarly, the \n\nmixture (an alloy) brass contain atoms of \ncopper (Cu) and zinc (Zn), while bronze \ncontain atoms of the elements copper (Cu) \nand tin (Sn).\n\nThe figure 6.4 shows a schematic \nsubmicroscopic picture of the types of \nmatter, namely, element, compound and \nmixture and also their characteristics. \n\nCan you tell?\n\n\n\n41\n\nElement Compound Mixture\nNitrogen molecules (N\n\n2\n) Nitrogen dioxide molecules (NO\n\n2\n) Mixture of N\n\n2\n and NO\n\n2\n\nOxygen molecules (O\n2\n) Nitric oxide molecules (NO) Mixture of N\n\n2 \nand O\n\n2\n\nConstituent substance of element \nis only one, and it is that element \nitself\n\nConstituent substance of a \ncompound is only one and it is \nthat compound itself\n\nConstituent substances of a \nmixture are two or more \nelements and/or compounds\n\nAll the atoms/molecules of an \nelement are alike \n\nAll the molecules of a compound \nare alike\n\nAtoms\\molecules of a mixture \nare of two or more types\n\nAll the atoms in a molecule of an \nelement are alike and are joined to \neach other by chemical bonds.\n\nThe constituent atoms of a \nmolecule of a compound are of \ntwo or more types and are joined \nto each other by chemical bonds.\n\nThe constituent molecules of \nmixture are different from each \nother and are not joined by \nchemical bonds.\n\nAtoms/molecules of different \nelements are different\n\nThe proportion of constituent \nelements in a compound is \nconstant.\n\nThe proportion of constituent \nsubstances in a mixture can \nchange.\n\n- Properties of a compound are \ndifferent than those of the \nconstituent elements\n\nThe proporties of constituent \nsubstances are retained in \nthe mixture.\n\n6.4 : Element, Compound, Mixture - a schematic submicroscopic picture and characteristics\n\nWater : A compound Pure water is a compound formed by chemical combination of the \nelements hydrogen and oxygen. Whatever may be the source  of water, the proportion of its \nconstituent elements oxygen and hydrogen by weight is always 8:1. Hydrogen is an inflammable \ngas while oxygen gas supports combustion. However, the compound water formed by chemical \ncombination of the gaseous elements hydrogen and oxygen is a liquid. It is neither inflammable \nnor does it support combustion. On the contrary it helps to extinguish fire. \nMilk : A mixture Milk is a mixture of water, lactose, fats, protein and a few more natural \nsubstances. The proportion of various ingredients of milk is different as per its source. The \nproportion of fats in cow milk is 3-5 %, while it is 6-9 % in buffalo milk. The ingredient water \nis naturally present in large proportion in milk. Therefore milk exists in liquid state. The \nsweetness of milk is due to the ingredient called lactose. In other words, the proporties of the \nconstituent substances are retained in milk.\n\nTypes of element \nTake the following objects : iron nail/sheet, copper wire, aluminium \nwire, a piece of coal. Rub each object on a fresh surface of sandpaper \nand observe. Hammer each object with force. (Take care not to hurt \n\nyourself.) Record your observations in the following table.\n\nDo you know?\n\nTry this\n\n\n\n42\n\nObject\nIs the surface shining? yes/\n\nno\nDoes the shape flatten/break into small pieces on \n\nhammering ?\n\nIron nail\n\nCopper wire\n\nAluminium wire\n\nCoal piece \n\nApparatus : Evaporating dish, tripod stand, burner, etc. \nChemicals : Camphor, washing soda, blue vitriol, sugar, glucose, urea.\n\nKeep the evaporating dish on the tripod stand (fig 6.4). \nTake some camphor in the evaporating dish. Heat the \ncamphor in the dish strongly with the help of a burner. \nFind out what remains behind in the evaporating dish. \nRepeat the above procedure using limestone, washing \nsoda, blue vitriol, sugar, glucose and urea instead of \ncamphor. Record your observation in the following table. \n(Do this activity carefully under the supervision of your \nteacher, as some of the powders may catch fire.) 6.4 Experimental figure\n\nPowder in the \nevaporating dish\n\nWhether there was a residue / no \nresidue in the evaporating dish\n\nColour of the residue\n\nCamphor\n\nLimestone\n\n......\n\nThe objects in the above activity are \nmade of the elements iron (Fe), copper (Cu), \naluminium (Al) and carbon (C) respectively. \nFill the following table on the basis of the \nobservations obtained on doing the above \ntwo tests on each of the objects.\n\nElements having a shiny surface\n\nElements that flatten on hammering\n\nElements with a dull surface\n\nElements that break on hammering\n\nTypes of compound\n\nEvaporating \ndish\n\nStand\n\nBurner\n\nCamphor\n\nYou saw in the above activity that on \nheating strongly some compounds give \nresidue while others do not give any residue \nor give a blackish residue. The black residue \nis mainly made of carbon. Moreover, when \nsuch compounds are strongly heated in air, \ncombine with oxygen to form some gaseous \nsubstances. In case their combustion is not \ncomplete, black coloured carbon remain \nbehind as residue. These compounds are \n\ncalled organic compounds or carbon \ncompounds. For example materials like, \ncarbohydrates, proteins, hydrocarbons (for \nexample, petrol, cooking gas) are made of \norganic compounds. The comphor, sugar, \nglucose and urea used in the above activity \nare organic compounds. On the other hand \nthe compounds that decompose on strong \nheating to leave a residue behind are \ninorganic compounds. Comman salt, soda, \n\nTry this\n\nYou noticed that element has different physical properties like lustre/paleness, malleability/\nbrittleness. According to that elements are classified. In early times, elements were classified \ninto 'Metals' and 'Non metals'. After invention of  new elements a new type 'Metalloid' is \ndiscovered. The detail study of these type elements will be made in chapter Metals and Non \nmetals. \n\n\n\n43\n\nrust, blue vitriol, limestone are inorganic compounds. In addition there is one more type of \ncompounds, namely complex compounds. The molecules of compounds have a complex \nstructure formed by many atoms and in the centre of this structure metal atoms are also \nincluded. Chlorophyll that contains magnesium, hemoglobin that contain iron,          \ncyanocobalamine (vitamin B-12) that contain cobalt are some examples of complex \ncompounds. \n\nVarious atoms in the molecules of compounds are joined by chemical bonds. We are \ngoing to look at that later. \nTypes of mixtures \n\nAll the particles of a solid that stay \ntogether (or are in the same container) \nconstitute a single phase. (eg., a heap of \nstones.) A liquid substance along with all \nthe soluble substances dissolved in it \ntogether constitute a single phase. (eg., \nsea water) A liquid or all its drops present \ntogether or in the same container \nconstitute a single phase. (eg., rain drops) \nThe liquids present together or in the \nsame container, but not mixed with each \nother, constitute separate phase. (eg., oil \nand water) All the gases present together \nconstitute a single phase. (eg., air)\n\nTake three beakers. Take 10 g common salt \nin the first beaker, 10 g saw dust in the second \nbeaker and 10 ml milk in the third beaker. Add \n100 ml water to all the three beakers and stir. \nwhich of the mixtures shows separate water \nphase? Place the three beakers in front of a \nvertically held paper and pass a laser beam \nthrough the beakers from the opposite side. (use \nthe laser beam under the guidance of teacher.) At \nthe same time  observe what appears on the paper \nin front of the beaker. Also look at the beaker \nfrom the side. Arrange three filtration assemblies \nusing conical flask, funnel and filter paper for \ndoing filtration. Stir the mixtures in the three \nbeakers and carry out filtration. Record all the \nobservations in the following table.\n\nAlways remember\n\nTake three beakers. Take a little sand and water in the first beaker. \nTake some crystals of blue vitriol and water in the second beaker. Take \nsome blue vitriol and sand in the third beaker. Stir the materials in all the \nthree beakers and observe. Record your observation in the following table.\n\nBeaker \nNumber\n\nMaterials taken\nWhat change seen on \n\nstirring\nNumber of phases in \n\nthe mixture \nTypes of mixture\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nThe part of matter having uniform composition is called phase. Write the third column of the \ntable the number of phases seen in each of the beakers ofter stirring. When all the components \nof a mixture form one phase, it is called homogeneous mixture. When the components of a \nmixture are distributed into two or more phases it is called a heterogeneous mixture.\n\nIn the above activity after stirring a homogeneous mixture is \nformed in only one beaker. Which is that ?\n\nBeaker\nComponents of \n\nthe mixture\n\nSeparate \naqueous phase \nseen/not seen\n\nTransperent/\nopaque\n\nComponents are separated/\nnot separated by filtration\n\nTry this\n\nTry this\n\nCan you tell?\n\n\n\n44\n\nSolution : A homogeneous mixture of two or \nmore substances is called solution. In the \nfirst beaker in the above activity a \nhomogeneous mixture of water and salt is \nformed. It is called a salt solution. That \ncomponent of a solution which is present in \nthe largest proportion is called solvent. The \nother components which are in less proportion \nthan the solvent are called solutes. The \nprocess of forming a solution by mixing \nsolutes in a solvent is called dissolution. \nAccording to the states of the components \nsolution can be of many types. The solution \nsuch as sea water, blue vitriol dissolved in \nwater, salt dissolved in water, sugar syrup \nare of the type solid in liquid. In addition to \nthis, the solution can also be of the types \nliquid in liquid (for example, vinegar, dilute \nsulphuric acid), gas in gas (for example, air) \nsolid in solid’ (for example, alloys like brass, \nsteel, stainless steel, etc), gas in liquid (for \nexample, chlorinated water, hydrochloric \nacid). The composition of a homogeneous \nmixture, that is to say solution, is uniform \nthroughout the bulk. If solvent is a transparent \nliquid, the solution is also transparent and it \npasses through a filter paper. \nSuspension : In the second beaker in the \nabove activity a heterogeneous mixture of \nwater and saw dust was formed. It is a \nmixture of a liquid and a solid. Heterogeneous \nmixture of a liquid and a solid is called a \nsuspension. The diameter of the solid \nparticles in a suspension is larger than 10-4 \nm.  Therefore light cannot transmit through \n\nit. More over these solid particles remain on \nan ordinary filter paper as residue and \ntherefore the liquid and solid components of \na suspension get separated by filtration.\nColloid : The mixture of water and milk in \nthe third beaker in the above activity is \ntransluscent. It means that, when light is \nincident on the surface of this mixture, it is \npartly transmitted and partly scattered. This \nis because the tiny particles of milk phase in \nthis heterogeneous mixture are dispered \nevenly in water phase, and the diameter of \nthese particles is around 10-5m. Such a \nheterogeneous mixture is called a colloid. \nHowever as the pores of an ordinary filter \npaper are larger than colloid, the \nheterogeneous mixture, cannot be separated \nby filtration. Milk is itself a colloid. In it, the \nsolid and liquid particles of proteins, fats, \netc. having a diameter around 10-5m are \ndispersed in the aqueous medium. Apart \nfrom this, there are some more types of \ncolloids such as ‘solid in gas’ (for example, \nsmoke), ‘liquid in gas’ (for example, fog, \ncloud), etc. \nLet us understand compounds : while \nstudying matter we have seen that element is \na type of matter having the simplest \ncomposition. On inspection of the \ncomposition of the types compound and \nmixture it is learnt that they are formed from \ntwo or more units. Whether these units are in \na joined state with each other or separate \ndecides whether the matter is a compound or \na mixture. \n\nin both the dishes and observe. Transfer the entire iron filings from the first dish to the second, \nstir with a glass rod and observe by taking the horseshoe magnet near the matter. Also observe \nthe colour of the matter. Now heat the matter in the second dish for a while and let it cool. \nObserve the colour change, if any in the matter and observe whether there is any effect of the \nhorseshoe magnet on it. Record all the observation in the following table.\n\nAction Colour of matter Effect of horseshoe magnet\n\nIron filings and sulphur were mixed in the dish\n\nIron filings and sulphur in the dish were heated \ntogether\n\nTry this\nTake two evaporating dishes. Take 7 g iron filings in the first dish \n\nand 4 g sulphur in the second. Take a horse shoe magnet near the matter \n\n\n\n45\n\nIn the above activity, on testing the \nmatter obtained by mixing iron filings and \nsulphur with horse shoe magnet (step 3) it \nwas found that the resulting matter was a \nmixture of iron and sulphur and possessed \nproperties of both the components. Some \nparticles were yellow. They were of sulphur. \nSome particles were black. They were iron \nparticles. The property of iron particles to \nget attracted towards magnet was unchanged. \nIn other words the components iron and \nsulphur were in free state in that matter. On \nthe contary when iron filings and sulphur \nwere heated together and cooled there was \nno effect of magnet and the characteristic \nyellow colour of sulphur also disappeared.\n\nFrom this we understand that the matter \nformed in the above activity is different from \n\nMolecular formulae of some compounds are given in the \nfollowing table.

A chemical \ncombination took place between iron and \nsulphur due to heating in the above activity. \nThe atom of iron and sulphur became joined \nby chemical bond to form molecules of  a \nnew compound. \nMolecular formula and valency : There is a \ndefinite proportion of the constituent \nelements in a compound. Certain number of \nthe atom of the constituent elements are \njoined to each other in a molecule of a \ncompound. Molecular formula indicates the \nnumber of atom of each of the constituent \nelements present in one molecule of a \ncompound. A molecular formula includes \nthe information regarding the symbols of the \nall the constituent elements and their \nrespective number as subscripts. \n\nCan you tell?\n\nDo you know?\n\nComplete the table  \n\nMolecular formulae of various compounds formed by \nhydrogen with other elements are given in the following table. \nFrom that, deduce the valencies of the concerned elements.\n\nWe have seen the relationship between a molecular formula and the number of atom of \nvarious elements in molecule. The ability of joining to another atom with a chemical bond is \na chemical property of each atom. This ability is indicated by a number and this number is \ncalled valency of that atom.

What are the metals and nonmetals that we use in everyday life?\n\n7. Metals and Nonmetals\n\nAll the objects or materials in the world are made from elements, compounds or their \nmixtures. Scientists classified all the elements into three general types which are metals, \nnonmetals and metalloids.\n\nMetals : Gold, silver, iron, copper, \naluminium, magnesium, calcium, sodium, \nplatinum are a few metals. Metals have \nlustre. The metals are hard. Wire or sheet \ncan be from them made metal. Metals are \ngood conductors of heat and electricity. \nMetals lose their valence electrons to \nproduce positively charged ions, that is, \ncations. \n\nPhysical Properties of Metals\n1. Physical State : Under ordinary \ntemperature metals stay in solid state. \nHowever metals like mercury and gallium \nare exception, which are in liquid state even \nat room temperature.\n\n4. Ductility :   Have you ever gone to a \ngoldsmith’s shop ? Have you seen the \ngoldsmith making a wire of gold or silver? \nWhen a metal is pulled through a hole its \nwire is formed. This property of metal is \ncalled ductility.\n\n5. Malleability :  Take an iron nail. Place \nit on a platform and keep on hammering \nit. After sometime you will see a thin sheet \nforming. This property is called malleability \nof metals.\n\n6. Conduction of Heat : Take a copper \nplate. Fix some wax at one of its ends. Heat \nthe other end and observe what happens. \nDiscuss with teacher. \nMetals are good conductors of heat. Silver, \ncopper and aluminium are the best conductors \nof heat. \n\n7.  Conduction of Electricity : Which metals \nare used to make electrical wires? Metals are \ngood conductors of electricity. Lead is an \nexception, which is neither a good conductor \nof heat nor a good conductor of elctricity. \n\n8. Density : Metals have high density \nSodium, potassium and lithium are exception, \nhaving lower density then water. The density \nof lithium is only 0.53 g/cc. \n\n9. Melting  point & Boiling Point : Generally \nmetals have high melting points and boiling \npoints. Exceptions : Hg, Ga, Na, K. \n\n10. Sonority : What is the metal that your \nschool bell is made of ? How does a bell is \nfunction? Metals are sonorous. They produce \nsound on striking.\n\nYou might have seen a doctor’s pressure \ngauge to measure blood pressure, during \nyour visit to a dispensary, accompanying \nyour relative. In that, you might have seen \na grey coloured liquid in a glass tube. What \nis that metal?\n2. Lustre : Take copper vessels at your \nhome. Scrub them with lemon and rinse with \nwater. Observe the lustre before and after \ncleaning. Light gets reflected from the \ncleaned or freshly cut surface of metal and \nthe metal looks lustrous.\n\n3. Hardness : Generally metals are hard, \nnot soft. Exception : Sodium and potassium \nare soft and can be easily cut by a knife. \n\nCan you recall?\n\nCan you recall?\n\n\n\n50\n\n1. Gold, Silver, Aluminium are highly \nmalleable metals. \n\n2. A sheet with thickness 1/10,000 mm \nand a wire with diameter 1/5000 mm \ncan be made from gold.\n\nNonmetals : Carbon, Sulphur,  Phosphorus \nare a few nonmetals. Generally nonmetals \nare brittle and nonlustrous. \n\nPhysical Properties of nonmetals :\n\n1. Physical State : At ordinary temperature \nnonmetals occur as solids, liquids and gases. \nFor example : Solids : C, S, P; Liquids : Br\n\n2\n;       \n\nGases : H\n2\n, N\n\n2\n, O\n\n2\n \n\n2. Lustre : Nonmetals do not have lustre, \nexcept diamond and iodine crystals. Some \nnonmetals are colourless while others have \ndifferent colours. What is the colour of \ncarbon in the form of coal ?  Sulphur is \n\nyellow and bromine is brown.\n\n3. Brittleness : Take coal and hammer it. \nSee what happens to it. Solid nonmetals are \nbrittle. Some nonmetals are soft. Diamond \n(an allotrope of carbon) is an exception, \n\nwhich is the hardest natural substance.\n\n4. Ductility & Malleability : Non metals are \nneither ductile nor malleable. \n\n5. Conduction of Heat & Electricity : Non \nmetals are bad conductors of heat and \nelectricity, except graphite (an allotrope of \ncarbon) which is a very good conductor of \nelectricity. \n\n6. Density : Nonmetals have low densities. \n\n7. Melting & Boiling Point : Nonmetals \nhave low melting and boiling points. \nExceptions : the solid nonmetals carbon and \nboron melt at high temperature. \n\nMetalloids : Some elements such as arsenic \n(As), Silicon (Si), Germanium (Ge), \nAntimony (Sb) have properties which are \nintermediate between metals and nonmetals. \nSuch elements are called metalloids.  \n\nChemical properties of Metals\n\na. Electronic configuration : Electronic \nconfiguration is the basis of chemical \nbehaviour of elements. Majority of metals \nhave upto three electrons in their outermost \nshell. \n\nMetal Atomic \nnumber\n\nElectronic \nconfiguration\n\n11\nNa 11 2, 8, 1\n\n12\nMg 12 2, 8, 2\n\n13\n Al 13 2, 8, 3\n\nb.

Reaction with acid : Take dilute \nhydrochloric acid in a test tube. Then add \nzinc dust to it.  Take a glowing splinter near \nthe mouth of the tube. Observe the glowing \nsplinter. You will notice some sound coming \nout from it. \n\nMost of the metals react with dilute \nacids to form metal salts while hydrogen gas \nis released. \nMetal + dilute Acid  Salt + Hydrogen gas. \ne. Reaction with water : Most metals do not \nshow any observable and fast reaction with \ncold water. But some metals like sodium and \npotassium react with cold water to produce \ntheir hydroxides and hydrogen gas. \nmagnesium metal requires steam to give \nsimilar reactions. \n\nChemical properties of nonmetals\na.

Nonmetals do not react with dilute \nacids.\n\nUses of metals and nonmetals\n\nName of metal Use Name of nonmetal Use\n\nWhile studying chemical properties of metals it is found that \n\ngold or silver do not react readily. \nCan you recall?\n\nMake a list and discuss Prepare a list of the uses of metals and nonmetals in our \neveryday life.\n\n\n\n52\n\nNoble Metal : Some metals like gold, silver, \nplatinum, paladium and rhodium are noble \nmetals. They occur in nature in the elemental \nstate. Gold which is100 percent pure is called \n24 carat gold. Pure gold is soft. As a result \nthe ornaments made from pure gold bend or \nbreak due to pressure. Therefore goldsmiths \nmix it with certain proportion of copper or \nsilver. Ornaments are made from 22 carat \ngold or gold with still smaller carat value. \n\nUses of Noble metals : \n1. Gold, silver and platinum are used to \n\nprepare ornaments.\n2. Silver used in medicines. (It has \n\nantibacterial property).\n3. Gold and silver also use to make medals.\n4. Gold and silver also used to make few \n\nelectronic devices.\n5. Platinum, palladium metals are used as \n\ncatalyst.\n\nPurity of Gold :\nWhen we ask rate of gold in gold shop, it \nalways differ ? Why is it ? Gold is a noble \nmetal, in nature it occurs in element form. \n100% pure gold is 24 carat. Pure gold is soft. \nTherefore gold ornaments prepared by pure \ngold may break or bend due to pressure. \nHence gold-smith add specific amount of \ncopper or silver in pure gold. To prepare \nornaments 22 carat gold is used.\n\nCarat Percentage\n\n24 100\n\n22 91.66\n\n18 75.00\n\n14 58.33\n\n12 50.00\n\n10 41.66\n\nCorrosion : Gases in the air react with \nmetals in presence of moisture to form metal \ncompounds. The metals get affected by this \n\nprocess and undergo what is called corrosion. \n\nThere is a statue of \nLiberty in the sea near New \nyork city in America. The \noriginal surface of their \nstatues was made of copper. \nBut now it, looks green. This \nis because green coloured \ncopper carbonate has been \nformed by a reaction of \ncopper with the carbon \ndioxide and moisture in the \nair. This is an example of \ncorrosion.\n\nPrepare a list of the examples of \ncorrosion in your everyday life. \n\nA reddish coloured deposit is formed on \niron by reaction with oxygen gas. A greenish \ncoloured deposit is formed on copper by \nreaction with carbondioxide gas. A blackish \ncoloured deposit is formed on silver by \nreaction with hydrogen sulphide gas. To \nprevent corrosion of metals, layers of oil, \ngrease, varnish and paint are applied on \nthem. Also plating with another noncorroding \nmetal is done.  Iron is arrested by zinc \nplating. Due to these processes the contact of \nmetal surface with air is lost and corrosion \ncannot occur as the chemical reaction cannot \noccur. \n\nAlloy : A homogeneous mixture of two \nor more metals or a homogeneous mixture \nmetal with nonmetals is called alloy. Alloys \nare made by mixing the constituent elements \nin as per the requirement. For example, the \nstainless steel utensils used at home are \nmade of an alloy of iron with carbon, \nchromium and nickel. The alloy bronze is \nformed from copper and tin.\n\nDo you know?\n\nMake a list and discuss \n\n\n\n53\n\nThere is an iron \npillar in the premices  \nof Kutubminar in \nDelhi, made about \n1500 year ago. The \npillar is lustrous even \nafter so many years. \nThis is becasuse our \nansestors had made it \nfrom an alloy.\n\n It contains small proportion of carbon, \nsilicon and phosphorus mixed in iron.\n\nYou might be knowing scrap dealers. \nWhat do they do with the scrap ? Why is \nthis needed ?\n\nA cheap variety of stainless steel is \nmade sometimes by using copper instead \nof costly nickel.

What should be done to overcome these problems?\n\nMany problems have been arisen on the earth due to human interference in the nature. \nIndustrialization, increasing population, mining, transportation, indiscriminate use of \npesticides and fertilizers are causing pollution on the earth. It is affecting human beings.\nPollution : Contamination of natural environment that will be harmful to ecosystems is called \nas pollution.\n\n8.1 Various problems of environment\n\n1. Where do you see the pollution around you?\n2. How does the pollution occur?\n\nPollutants :\nFactors affecting natural functions of ecosystem \n\nand causing harmful effects on abiotic and biotic \nfactors are called as pollutants. Pollutants make the \nenvironment poisonous and unhealthy.\n\nPollutants may be natural or manmade. Natural \npollutants are destroyed in due course of time by \nnature’s rule; however, manmade pollutants are not.\n\nIf natural materials are pollutants, why do we not perceive their \nadverse effects during their use?

There had been thick fog in London due to air \n\npollution during 5th – 9th Dec.1952. Smoke due \nto burning of coal had been mixed. Dark shadow \nof this SMOG remained on the city for \nconsecutive 5 days. Same situation occurred \nagain during 3rd – 6th Dec.1962.\n\n2. In 1948, Petersburg was named as 'BLACK \nCITY' when smoke and soot casued night like \nsituation during day time. \n\n Worst ever industrial accident had been occurred in Bhopal on the night of                           \n2nd Dec.1984. Eight thousand people had been died due to accidental gas leakage. \nCollect more information about Bhopal gas accident discuss the nature of accident, \nreasons, aftereffects, preventive measures.\n\n8.4 Air pollutants: Sources and effects\n\nS r . \nNo.\n\nAir Pollutants Source Effects\n\n1.

What is importance of ozone layer?\n2. What are reasons for depletion in ozone layer?\n\nCan you recall?\n\nDo you know?\n\n\n\n57\n\nEffect of air pollution on plants and animals\nDepletion in Ozone layer : Earlier, we have studied that ozone layer is present below the \nstratosphere, at the height of 48 kilometres from earth’s surface. It protects the living world \nof the earth from ultraviolet rays (UV-B) radiating from the Sun. However, nowadays, ozone \nlayer is getting depleted due to following reasons.\nGreen house effect and Global \nwarming : Though CO\n\n2  \nis present in \n\nvery less quantity in atmosphere, it \nplays very important role of absorption \nof solar heat. Over the last 100 years, \nproportion of CO\n\n2 \n has been increased \n\ndue to industrialization. Effect of this \nCO\n\n2 \n on the earth’s temperature is \n\nnothing but green house effect. Similar \nto CO\n\n2 \n, nitrous oxide, methane and \n\nCFC also trap the heat. Collectively, \nthese are called as green house gases.\n\n8.6 Acid rain\n\n Global temperature is gradually increasing due to green house effect. Due to this, \natmosphere is changing, causing disturbances in agricultural yield, distribution of wild \nanimals. Icebergs and glaciers are melting causing increase in sea level.\n\nAcid Rain : Oxides of sulphur and \nnitrogen are released into atmosphere \nthrough burning of coal, timber and fuel \noils. Those oxides mix with rain water \nand form acids like sulphuric acid, nitric \nacid, nitrous acid, etc. These acids mix \nwith rain drops and snowflakes and come \ndown as rain, called as acid rain.\nEffects of acid rain:\n1. Acidity of soil and water bodies \n\nincreases due to acid rain. It harms \nthe aquatic organisms, plants and \nentire forest life. Total ecosystems are \nadversely affected.\n\n2. Erosion of buildings, busts, historical monuments, bridges, metal idols, wire fences, etc. \noccurs due to acid rain.\n\n3. Heavy metals like mercury and cadmium are absorbed up by plants and thereby enter the \nfood chain indirectly due to acid rain.\n\n4. Due to acidification of water in water bodies and pipes, leaching of metal and plastic \nmaterial occurs in water and thereby serious health problems arise.\n\n8.5 Green House effect\n\nOxides\n\nAcid rain\n\nAcid\n\nDamage of animals \nand plants\n\nBurning fuels\n\nAtmosphere\n\nEnergy emitted by \nSun is absorbed in \natmosphere\n\nEnergy emitted by \nSun is absorbed by \nearth surface\n\nInfrared \nradiationEarth\n\n\n\n58\n\n Air pollutants with sulphur cause colour change in paints, oil paintings, nylon, cotton \nfabrics, leather articles and papers etc.\n\nAir Quality Index \nIt is important for citizens to know the \n\nextent of air pollution in their city. So as to \ndefine the air quality index, proportion of SO\n\n2\n, \n\nCO, NO\n2\n, ozone, particulate matter, etc. is \n\nmeasured every day.\nBoards indicating the air quality index are \n\ndisplayed in busy squares in metro cities.\n\nLarge number of tanning centers are present in Tamilnadu. Waste water from those centers \nis released into Palar river. Hence that river is referred as Puzzar (Gutter river).\n\nPreventive measures of air pollution\n1. Smoke emerging from factories \n\ncontains harmful particles. Hence, \npollution controlling machinery \nshould be used. Ex. Arresters, filters.\n\n2. Proper disposal of stinking waste \ngenerated in cities.\n\n3. Control on atomic tests, chemical \nweapons, etc.\n\n4. Control / ban over CFC production.\n\nB. Water Pollution : \n\n1. From which water sources do we get the \nwater suitable to use?\n\n2. For which different purposes do we use the \nwater?\n\n3. How much percent of the earth’s area is \noccupied by water?\n\n4. What are the reasons of water pollution?\n5. Why does water is referred as ‘molecule \n\nof life’?\nWater is said to be polluted when it \n\nbecomes unclean and poisonous due to \nmixing of natural or artificial unwanted \nmaterial, when it becomes harmful to living \norganisms due to decreased oxygen content, \nwhen epidemic diseases are spread through \nthe water.\n\nFresh water or marine water pollution \nincludes physical, chemical and biological \nchanges.\n\nWater Pollutants\nA. Biological pollutants : Water does not \n\nremain potable due to algae, bacteria, \nviruses, parasites, etc. Diseases are \nspread due to biological pollution.\n\nB. Inorganic pollutants : Suspended particles \nlike fine sand, dust, soil, precipitates of \nsalt, compounds of arsenic, cadmium, \nlead, mercury, and traces of radioactive \nmaterial.\n\nC. Organic pollutants : Weedicides, \ninsecticides, fertilizers, sewage, industrial \neffluents, etc.\n\n8.7 Water pollution\n\nCan you tell?\n\nDo you know?\n\nDo you know?\n\nDo you know?\n\n\n\n59\n\n1.

Soil Pollution :\n\n1. What is meant by soil erosion?\n\n2. What are reasons for depletion in soil fertility?\n\nRelationship of soil pollution with air and water pollution\n\nIf wet waste is dumped at wrong places instead of composting, pathogens grow upon it, \nwhich are then mixed with water causing water pollution.\n\nInsecticides, chemical fertilizers, weedicides are used in agriculture, which causes soil \npollution. Excessively sprayed insecticides and weedicides are mixed with air causing air \npollution. Similarly, excessive use of chemical fertilizers causes water pollution.\n\nSoil pollution occurs due to mixing of human wastes, birds and animals waste. This \nreleases various stinking gases causing air pollution. Same waste may cause water pollution \nif mixed with water.\n\nPollution - Prevention and control : Government of India has enacted some laws for control, \nregulation and prevention of pollution. Following are laws regarding pollution control.\n\n1. Water pollution and prevention act, 1974. 2. Air pollution and prevention act, 1981.\n\n3. Environmental Protection Act, 1986.\n\nVarious laws and rules are in force in relation to biomedical waste, harmful effluents, \nsolid waste and sound pollution. Government statutory bodies like Maharashtra Pollution \nControl Board and Central Pollution Control Board supervise about whether the industries, \nindustrial areas, local governing bodies like municipalities, district councils, panchayat \nsamiti, gram panchayat, etc. follow the laws about pollution control.\n\nOut of the total land area of the soil, some is covered by ice; some is desert, whereas some \nis occupied by mountains and hills. Very less area of land is available for human use.\n\nSoil is said to be polluted when there are changes in its physical biological and chemical \nproperties and its fertility decreases due to either natural or manmade reasons. \n\nCompare this\n\nEffects of soil pollution\n\n1. Soil fertility decreases due to mixing of salty, \nacidic water from industry.\n\n2. Radioactive and other pollutants enter and \npass through food chain like the soil, crop, \nwater and human body.\n\n3. Problem of water pollution increases due to \nsoil pollution. Toxic substances leach into \nwater. Similarly, diseases spread through \nvarious pathogens.\n\nCan you recall?\n\nCompare two \nneighbouring \nphotographs.\n\n\n\n61\n\n1.  Following are some statements about \npollution. Which type of pollution do \nthose express?\na. Fog seems to be appearing in Delhi \n\nduring day hours.\nb.

Disaster Management\n\n1. What do you mean by disaster ?\n2. What are the different types of disaster?\n\n     Last year we have introduced various natural calamities/disasters. This year we are going \nto study about earthquake and some other natural calamities.\n\nWhat is an earthquake ? what are the effects of earthquake ?\n\nEarthquake \nSudden vibrations on the earth and \n\nshaking of the earth surface /ground is called \nan earthquake. These cause seismic waves \nleading to movements of the earth’s surface \nlike tremors, shaking or it goes up-down.\n   The shocks and waves formed in the interior \nof the earth spread on the surface in all \ndirections. The central point of earthquake is \nthe point above the epicenter on the earth \nsurface. Strong convulse or waves at first \nreach to the epicenter, therefore major loss \noccurs near to that area.\n\n Shocks occurred due to an earthquake \ncan be mild or intensified (acute). On the \nearth mild earthquakes occur in a larger \nnumber than the intensified or Runners .\n  Everyday, earthquakes are noticed at some \nor the other places on the earth. According to \nthe observation of ‘National Earthquakes \ninformation center’ every year nearly 12,400 \nto 14,000 earthquakes occur on the earth.            \n( Ref:- www.tris.edu.) From this it is noticed \nthat earth is continuously vibrating.\n\n       The machine / Instrument which \nrecords the earthquakes is called \n‘Seismograph’ or ‘Seismometer’, and the \naccentuation (intensity) is measured in \n‘Richter Scale’. This is one of the \nmathematical measuring unit.\n   Effects of earthquakes are mentioned \nbelow. Study them carefully.\n\n9.3 Seismometer\n\nVertical seismometer Horizontal seismometer\n\nInternet My Friend Collect the information about Richter Scale and effects of earthquake\n\n9.1 Cracks to the buildings\n\nEpicentre\n\nFocal point Seismic waves\n\nPlate movement\n\nCan you tell?\n\nCan you recall?\n\n\n\n63\n\n9.4 Precautions to be taken \n(c)\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\nCauses of an earthquake Effects of an earthquake\n\n1.Volcanic eruption.\n2. Stress of big dams on the earth.\n3. Mining.\n4. Underground atomic tests.\n5. Water percolates through the cracks of the \n\nearth. Due to tremendous heat, the water \nconverts into steam. The steam formed tries \nto come out from the loosened earth surface \ncausing earthquakes.\n\n1. Loss of human beings, wild animals and pets.\n2. Economic loss at large scale ( Electric poles, pipelines, \n\nhouses, buildings, roads, railway tracks are destroyed.)\n3. Ecosystem destruction due to the loss of Biodiversity.\n4. Direction of flow of rivers, streams changes.\n5. Possibility of fire in cities increases.\n6. If there is earthquake at the bottom of ocean, it may \n\ncreate tsunami waves and thereby large scale \ndestruction of costal region.\n\n7. Level of water-table changes.\n\nPrecautions to be taken at the time of Earthquake \n\n1. If you are at home, then, do not get scared and \ninstead of running here and there, stand still at \none place. Either sit on the floor or below the bed \nor any other furniture and cover yourself until the \nmovement of earth stops. If there is no table or \nany other shelter then sit in any corner of the \nroom and cover your head by folding your hands \naround it.\n\n2. If you are in the vehicle or outside the house, \nthen park your vehicle at a safe place and sit \ninside it. Do not wait near  or below tall building, \ntrees or electric pole.\n\nAvoid doing following things during earthquake\n1. Avoid using lift in the multistoried building, \n\ninstead use staircase.\n2. Do not sit in discomfort for long. Do some \n\nphysical movements.\n3. After the earthquake there is a possibility of fire, \n\nhence, to avoid it  carefully switch off the main \nelectric supply. Do not use candles, lantern, or \nmatchbox, instead use torch or battery.\n\nEarthquake Resistant / Proof Buildings : The constructions which do not get damaged due \nto earth movements upto a certain limit, are called earthquake resistant buildings. To construct \ntall buildings, ‘Indian Standard Institute’ has made some code of conduct . Buildings are \nconstructed as per I.S. 456 and earthquake resistant constructions are performed as per                     \nIS 1893 (Criteria for earthquake resistant design of structure) and IS 13920 (Ductile detailing \nof reinforced concrete structures subjected to seismic forces). Advanced technology is used for \nearthquake resistant construction.\n\nTo get prior intimation about earthquake, modern equipments like laser ranging very \nlong baseline, geiger counter, creep meter, strain meter, tide gauge, tilt meter, volumetric \nstrain gauge etc. are used.\n\n\n\n64\n\nFire\n\nFire is a natural calamity or man made calamity ?\n\nTypes Of Fire \n1. Class A Fire (Solid substances) : \nCommonly flammable materials are their \nfuel source. (wood, clothes, coal, papers \netc.) This fire can be put out with water.\n2. Class B Fire (Liquid substances) :    Fires \ncaused due to flammable liquid substances \n(petrol, oil, varnish, solvents, cooking oil, \npaints etc.) All these substances are lighter \nthan water, therefore, fire extinguishers can \nbe used to extinguish fire.\n3. Class C Fire (Gaseous Substances) : \nFires caused due to acetylene, household gas \n(L.P.G.)  \n4. Class D Fire (Chemical substances) :     \nFires caused due to combustible metals like \npotassium, sodium and calcium, which react \nwith water at normal room temperature. \nMagnesium, aluminum and zinc react with \nwater at high temperature. When both these \ngroups combine with water, it explodes.\n5. Class E Fire ( Electrical) :     A fire caused \ndue to electrical components is class E fire. \nTo extinguish such fire, power is cut off and \nnon-conductive fire extinguishers like \ncarbon dioxide are used. \n\nPrecautions and Safety Measures \n1. Develop the habit of switching off the gas regulator when not in use specially during \n\nnight. Switch off the electrical appliances when you are going out of the house.\n2. To make others alert and call them for help, shout loudly.\n3. Call fire brigade.\n4. Provide information how to use fire extinguishers.\nFirst Aid\n    Let the patient sit / sleep in a comfortable position and call the doctor immediately.\n\nLandslides- Rift collapse\n\n1. What are the reasons for ‘Malin’ mishap in Pune district? What \nare its effects?\n\n2. What is the landslide ?\n\nCan you recall?\n\nCan you recall?\n\nMethods of Fire Extinction : There are \n3 main methods to stop the spreads of \nfire or to control the fire.\n1. Cool Out (Use of Water) : To \nextinguish fire water is most common \nand effective solution which is easily \navailable everywhere. If you spray \nwater on the fire or around the fire it \ncreates cooling effect and helps to \ncontrol the fire.\n2. Suppress the Fire : To control the \nfire which is caused due to electricity or \noil, sand or soil can be used. If we spread \na froth like substance on the fire, it cuts \noff the contact between air and fire. This \nmethod is more useful to extinguish the \nfire spread due to oil.\n3. Keep away Flammable Substances : \nIn this method, all flammable substances \nare kept away from the fire. Any wooden \narticle or flammable substances must be \nkept away so that no source is left for \nthe fire to spread. Stirr up pump is the \nbest device to put off small fires. It \nsprays water in all directions around the \nfire.\n\n\n\n65\n\nNatural cracks and fissures present in hard rocks cause their breaking. Especially, at the \ntime of heavy rains, water entering these cracks causes weathering of these rocks. Weight \nincreases, these rocks slide on the sloppy region and settle at the lower side. This is called \ncollapse of rift.\n\nCauses of landslide \n1. After effects of natural disasters like earthquake,  \n\ntsunami, heavy rains, storms, floods cause landslide.\n2. Unlimited cutting of trees causes soil erosion.\n3. While building roads in mountains, there is a lot of \n\ndigging, that makes the mountain weak.\n\nEffects of landslide \n1. Rivers get flooded and change their paths.\n2. Displacement of waterfalls, formation of artificial \n\nwater reservoirs.\n\nIn Maharashtra where \ndo the traffic jams occur due \nto landslides? Make a list of \nsuch places. Why do the \nlandslide occur at those \nplaces only? Discuss in the \nclassroom and suggest \npreventive measures.\n\nMake a list and discuss \n\n3. There is live and financial loss on a large scale, as trees, buildings, rocks on sloppy area \ncollapse on low-lying land.\n\n4. Landslide affects the traffic.\n5. Landslide destroys plant life on it.\n\nDisaster relief – planning :   If the plan is prepared, it will help any disaster relief in the \nschool. For that prepare a chart as given below. \n\nMain points The things to be noted\n\nPrimary information \nof the school \n\na. Name and address of the school\nb.

Which instrument had you used to observe cells ? \n\n Last year, we studied that cell is the structural and functional unit of living organisms. \n\nAccording to the functions, cells of different sizes and structures are found in different organs. \nStructure of the cell  \n\nObserve the following figures, write the names and complete the \nchart.\n\nComponent Animal cell Plant cell\nCell membrane Present Present\nCell wall . . . . . . . . . ..\n. . . . . Present Absent\nPlastids . . . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . Present Present\nVacuole . . . . . . . . . .\nGolgi complex . . . . . . . . . .\nMitochondria . . . . . . . . . .\n\n10. Cell and Cell Organelles\n\nWe must study each and every part \nof the cell to understand the processes \n\noccuring within the cell.  \n\nComponents of a cell    \n1. Cell wall : It is found around cells of algae, fungi and plants. Animal cells lack cell wall. \nCell wall is an elastic and strong coat around cell membrane. It is mainly composed of \ncarbohydrates like cellulose and pectin. Afterwards, polymers like lignin, suberin, cutin are \nadded in cell wall as per need. Functions of cell wall are to support and to protect the cell by \n\npreventing entry of excess water in the cell.\n\n2. Plasma membrane/cell membrane : It is a thin, fragile and elastic covering that separates \nthe cell components from outer environment. \n\n10.1 : Plant cell and Animal cell\n\nCan you recall?\n\nObserve\n\n\n\n68\n\n Structure of plasma membrane - \nProtein molecules are embedded in two \nlayers of phospholipids.\n\nPlasma membrane is said to be a \nselectively permeable membrane as it \nallows some substances to enter the cell, \nwhile prevents other substances.\n\nDue to this property, useful  molecules \nof water, salt and oxygen enter the cell and \nCO\n\n2\n exits the cell. \nIf any changes occur outside  the cell, \n\nthe celllular environment does not change \ndue to plasma membrane. This condition is \ncalled homeostasis. \n\n10.3 Structure of Plasma membrane\n\nHow do substances travel in the cell ?\nActivities that consume cellular energy\n1. Endocytosis - To gulp/engulf food and \nother substanes from outer environment.\n2. Exocytosis - To excrete waste materials \nout of cell.\nProcesses those that don’t consume \ncellular energy\n\nOsmosis in plant cell\n\n10.4 Osmosis\n\nVacuole\n\n10.2 Structure of cell wall\n\nPrimary \ncell wall\n\nPectin\nHemicelluose\n\nMiddle \nlamella\n\nPlasma \nmebrane\n\nSoluble \nproteins\n\nCarbohydrate\nchain\n\nProtein\n\n1. Diffusion - Entry or exit of small molecules like  O\n2\n, CO\n\n2\n \n\n2. Osmosis - The travelling of water from a part with more water to a part with less water, \nthrough a selctively permeable membrane is osmosis. It is a physical process with 3 possibilities.\n\nCellulose \nmicrofibre\n\nLipid bilayer\n\n1. Keep 4-5 raisins in water and observe after an hour. Afterwards, keep the same raisins \nin sugar solution and observe after an hour. Note down the observations and discuss in \nthe classroom.\n\n2. Wooden doors fit very tightly in rainy season. Why does it happen ?\n\nCan you tell?\n\nResearch\n\nOsmosis in animal cell\n\nhypertonic Isotonic Hypotonic\n\nH\n2\nO\n\nH\n2\nO\n\n\n\n69\n\na. Isotonic solution - Medium outside and inside the cell has same proportion of water, water \ndoesn’t go in or out.\nb. Hypotonic solution - The cell has less water than outside medium, so water enters the cell. \nThis is called endomosis. Eg. If raisins are kept in water, after sometime they swell and \nbecome turgid.\nc. Hypertonic solution -\n The cell has more water than the outside medium so water comes out of the cell. \nEg. If fruit pieces are kept in thick saturated sugar solution, the water from fruit pieces enter \nthe sugar solution. So the fruit pieces shrink after a while. If plant cell or animal cell is kept \nin hypertonic solution, water comes out of the cell by the process of exosmosis and there is \n\ncontraction of cytoplasm. This process is called plasmolysis. \n3. Cytoplasm - \n\nHave you seen the fully turgid, rectangular cells of onion            \npeelings ? \n\nCytoplasm is the fluid between plasma \nmembrane and nucleus. It is a moving, sticky \nsubstance. Many cell organelles are suspended \nin cytoplasm. Cytoplasm is the medium for \ncellular chemical reactions. The part of \ncytoplasm other than organelles is the cytosol.  \nCytosol stores vital substances like amino acids, \nglucose, vitamins, etc. In animal cells, cytoplasm \nis more granular and dense while in plant cells, \nit is thin and mostly pushed to the periphery due \nto a larger central vacuole.\n\nCell organelles :  An organelle is a \nspecialized subunit having specific function \nwithin the cell. They are ‘organs of the cell.’ \nEach organelle has its own lipoprotein \nmembrane. Except nucleus and chloroplast, all \nother organelles can be seen only with electron \n\nmicroscope. \nNucleus\n\nCells of \nonion peeling\n\nCell wall\n\nNucleus\n\nCytoplasm\n\nVacuole\n\nActivity - Take a drop of water on a clean glass slide. Using an ice-cream spoon, gently \nscrape the inner surface of your cheek.  With a needle, transfer a little material from spoon to \nthe water drop on the slide and spread it evenly. Put a drop of methylene blue stain on the \nsmear. Put a cover slip and observe under microscope. Did you observe the cells with blue \n\nnucleus? \nThe dark round spot seen under the microscope while observing the onion peeling stained \n\nwith iodine is the nucleus of the cell.\n\n10.5 Onion peeling\n\n10.6  Electron microscope\n\nCan you recall?\n\nTry this\n\n\n\n70\n\n When observed under electron microscope, \nwe can see nucleus covered by a double layered \nmembrane with small pores. These pores allow \nthe passage of material in and out of the nucleus. \nNucleus has one round nucleolus and a network \nof chromatin fibres. Chromatin fibres are thin \nthread like structures, which condense to form \nshort thick chromosomes at the time of cell \ndivision. Functional segments on chromosomes \n\nare called genes.\n\nFunctions of nucleus \n1.  It controlls all metabolic activities of the cell \n\nand also the cell division. \n2.  It is involved in the transmission of hereditary \n\ncharacters from parents to offsprings. \n \n\nEndoplasmic Reticulum (ER)  \n\n10.8 Endoplasmic Reticulum \n\nNucleus\nRibosome\n\nThe organelle which conducts various \nsubstances inside the cell is called \nendoplasmic reticulum. E.R. has a net like \nstructure consisting of interconnected \nminiature tubes and sheets filled with fluid. \nE.R. is connected to nucleus from innerside \nto plasma membrane from outer side.\n\nRough ER has ribosome grannules on \n\nits outer surface.\n\nFunctions of ER \n1.  It is the framework that supports cell. \n2.  Conduction of proteins. \n3.  Toxins that have entered the body through food, air and water are made water soluble by \n\nER and then flushed out of the body. \n·  What materials are used to pack your favorite biscuits and \n\nchocolates? \n·  What is the function of ‘Packing department’ of any factory? \n\n10.7 Nucleus\n\nChromatin\n\nNuclear \nmembrane\n\nNucleolus\nNuclear \npore\n\nHow many types of pipelines are there in your building/home ? \nWhat are their functions ?

The proteins coming \nfrom ER are enclosed in vesicles, which come \ntowards  golgi complex via cytoplasm. They \nfuse with the formation face of the golgi \nmembranes and empty their contents in the \ncisternae.\n\nAs they pass through the cisternae, they \nare chemically modified with the help of \nenzymes. They are again packed in the \nvesicles. These vesicles exit from the \nmaturation face. Thus, cisternae work like like \na packing department that packs and distributes \n\nsubstances.\n\nFunctions \n1.  Golgi complex is the secretory organ of the \n\ncell. \n2.  It modifies, sorts and packs materials \n\nsynthesized in the cell (enzymes, mucus, \nproteins, pigments etc.) and dispatches \nthem to various targets like plasma \nmembrane, lysosome etc. \n\n3.  It produces vacuoles and secretory vesicles.\n4.  It helps in the formation of cell wall, \n\nplasma membrane and lysosomes. \n\nLysosomes \n\n10.10 Lysosomes\n\n What happens to the agricultural waste after a few days when it \nis dumped in a compost pit ?\n\nDue to various metabolic activities in the cell, organic \nwaste is generated. Lysosomes digest the waste.\n\nLysosomes are simple, single membrane bound sacs, \n\nfilled with digestive enzymes. \nFunctions \n1.  Immune system - It destroys viruses and bacteria that \n\nattack the cell. \n2.  Demolition squads - It is destroys worn out cellular \n\norganelles and organic debris. (Autolysis) \n3.  Suicide Bags - When a cell becomes old or is damaged, \n\nlysosomes burst and enzymes digest their own cells. \n4.  During starvation, lysosomes digest stored proteins, \n\nfats. \n\nSingle membrane\n\nEnzyme complex\n\nCan you tell?\n\nIntroduction to scientists\nCamilio Golgi described the Golgi \ncomplex for the first time. He developed \nthe staining technique called 'Black \nreaction' and with the help of it, he studied \nnervous system. \n\nHe won the Nobel \nprize of 1906 along \nwith Santiago Cajal \nfor the study of \nstructure of nervous \nsystem.\n\n\n\n72\n\nMitochondria\n\n Which type of energy is required to run  the fans, computers \nand electric bulbs ? Where is this energy produced ? \n\nEach cell requires energy and this energy \nis produced in the mitochondria. Under the \nelectron microscope, a mitochondrion is seen \nas a double membrane structure. \n The outer membrane is porous and the \ninner membrane is deeply folded. These \nfolds are called ‘cristae’. The inner cavity is \nfilled with proteinaceous gel like matrix \ncontaining ribosomes, phosphate granules \nand DNA. Therefore it can produce its own \nproteins. With the help of enzymes, \nmitochondria oxidise carbohydrates and fats \nin the cell. The energy released in this process \nis stored in the mitochondria in th form of \nATP (Adenosine Tri Phosphate). Plant cells \n\nhave less mitochondria than animal cells.\n\nFunctions \n1. To produce energy-rich compound- ATP. \n2. Synthesis of proteins, carbohydrates, \n\nlipids etc. by using the energy in ATP. \n\n10.12 Vacuoles\n\nWhat is the benefit of foldings of inner membrane in \nmitochondria ? \n\nVacuoles \nVacuoles are the storage sacs for solid or liquid contents. \n\nThey don’t have any typical shape or size. The structure of \nthe vacuole changes according to the need of the cell. Vacuole \n\nis bound by single membrane. \nFunctions \n1. To maintain the osmotic pressure of the cell. \n2. To store metabolic byproducts and end products. (Glycogen, \n\nproteins, water etc). \n3. In animal cell, they store waste products and food, while in \n\namoeba it stores food before digestion. \n4. In plant cell, vacuoles are full of cell sap and provide \n\nturgidity, rigidity to them. \n\n10.11 Mitochondria\n\nInnner membrane\n\nOuter membrane\n\nCristae\n\nMatrix\n\nMitochondria are absent in RBCs. \nDue to this, the oxygen which is carried by \nthem is not used for themselves. \n\nPlastids : Why are plant leaves green and flowers red, yellow, orange or blue ?

Raw green \ntomatoes turn red due to breakdown of \nchlorophyll and synthesis of lycopene. \nChloroplast\nActivity - Take out a thin peel of Rheo or \nCroton leaf and observe the chromoplasts \nunder the compound microscope.\n\nChloroplasts are important for the \nphotosynthesis process that takes place in \nthe leaves. Chlorophyll in chloroplast traps \nsolar energy and converts it to chemical \nenergy. Stroma in the chloroplast contains \nenzymes, DNA, ribosomes and carbohydrates \n\nthat are necessary for photosynthesis. \n\nFunctions  \n1. Chloroplasts convert solar energy to chemical energy (food). \n2. Chromoplasts give different colours to flowers and fruits. \n3. Leucoplasts are involved in the synthesis and storage of food like starch, oils and proteins.\n\nMitochondria and plastids can produce proteins as well as replicate themselves, as they \nhave their own DNA and ribosomes.\n\nAfter studying the cell and cell organelles, you must have come to know that all the \nfunctions in plant and animal cells are taking place smoothly due to the cell organelles.

Human Body and Organ System\n\n1. From what the organs and organ systems are made up of? \n2. Which organ systems are present in human  body? \n\n    In the last class, we have studied some characters of living organisms. All the vital \nprocesses which are essential properties of living beings, are collectively called as life \nprocesses. \n\n1. Which processes occur in our body during sound sleep? \n2. Which  life processes occur continuously in our body? \n\n    Different organs in our body are working in group so as to smoothly carry out various life \nprocesses. These life processes takes place in various steps. Specific organs carry out the \nspecific steps. Group of organs working together to perform a specific function is called as \norgan system. Various  organ systems  like digestive, respiratory, circulatory, nervous, \nexcretory, reproductive, skeletal, muscular, etc. are functioning in our body. \n\nWhich different organs perform the function of breathing in \nthe body of animals? \n\n    Energy is essential to operate all the life processes in human body. Energy production \noccurs within the cells. Cells need the supply of soluble nutrients and oxygen for this purpose. \nThis supply takes place with the help of respiratory and circulatory systems. Respiration is \ncarried out through following three steps. \n\n1. External Respiration: \nA. Inspiration / Inhalation : Air is taken in \nthrough nose and sent towards the lungs through \ntrachea (wind pipe). \nB. Expiration / Exhalation : Oxygen from the \ninspired air goes into blood. Blood carries the \nCO\n\n2\n from various parts of body towards lungs. \n\nThis air is given out by exhalation. \n   Both of these processes occurring with the help \nof lungs are collectively called as external \nrespiration. \n2. Internal Respiration : Exchange of gases \nbetween cells and tissue fluid is called as internal \nrespiration. Oxygen moves from blood into tissue \nfluid and carbon dioxide moves from tissue fluid \ninto blood.\n3. Cellular Respiration : Dissolved nutrients \nlike glucose are slowly burnt (oxidized) with the \nhelp  of oxygen and  energy is released in the \nform of ATP. Waste materials like CO\n\n2 \nand \n\nwater vapours are produced during this process. \nCellular respiration can be summarized as \nfollows.\nC\n\n6\nH\n\n12\nO\n\n6\n+6O\n\n2\n6CO\n\n2\n+6H\n\n2\nO+ Energy (38ATP)\n\nAlong with the heat; sound and light \nare also produced during burning of fuel. \nSimilarly, whether the sound and light \nare produced during oxidation of \nnutrients in cell? \n\n1. Which organs are present in the \nrespiratory system? \n\n2. One should not talk while eating. Why \nis it so? \n\nHow do the  organisms like \namoeba, earthworm, cockroach, plants, \nvarious aquatic animals, birds respire? \nPrepare a chart. \n\nUse your brain power\n\nCan you tell?\n\nCan you tell?\n\nCan you recall?\n\nCan you recall?\n\nThink about it.\n\n\n\n76\n\n1. Nose : Respiratory system and respiration \nbegins with nose. Air is filtered with the help \nof hair and mucus present in the nose. \n\n2. Pharynx : Food  pipe and wind pipe \noriginate in the pharynx. Wind pipe is present \nin front of the food pipe. There is a lid at the \nbeginning of wind pipe. This lid closes the \nwind pipe during passing of food into food \npipe and thereby normally prevents the entry \nof food particles into wind pipe. Otherwise, \nwind pipe remains open. Hence air passes \nthrough pharynx into wind pipe. \n\n3. Wind pipe : Wind pipe is swollen at the \nbeginning due to sound box. Wind  pipe \nbifurcates in the thorax. One branch enters \nthe right lung and the other into left lung. \n\n4. Lungs : A lung is present on either sides of \nheart in thoracic cavity. Maximum area of \nthoracic cavity is occupied by lungs and they \ncover the  maximum part of heart. Each lung \nhas double layered covering. It is called as \npleura. Lungs are elastic like a sponge. Lungs \nare made  up of many small compartments, \ncalled as alveoli. Rich network of capillaries \nis present around each alveolus. \n\n    Walls of alveoli and capillaries are \nextremely thin. Gaseous exchange  can easily \ntake place across these thin walls. As large \nnumber of alveoli is present in lungs, larger \nsurface is available for gaseous exchange. \n\nExchange of gases in lungs :   Gaseous  exchange occurs continuously while blood is \ncirculating around the alveoli. An iron containing protein- hemoglobin  is present in the RBCs \nof blood. Hemoglobin absorbs the oxygen from air within alveoli. Simultaneously, CO\n\n2\n  and \n\nwater vapours move  from blood into the alveoli. Thus, oxygen is taken into the blood and \nCO\n\n2\n and water vapours are removed from the blood and given out by exhalation. \n\n5. Diaphragm :  A muscular partition is present at the base of thoracic cage. This partition is \ncalled as diaphragm. It is present between  the thoracic cavity and abdominal cavity. \nSimultaneous rising up of ribs and lowering of diaphragm causes the decrease in pressure on \nlungs. Due to this, air moves into the lungs through nose. When ribs return to their original \nposition and diaphragm rises up, pressure on the lungs increases. Due to this, air moves out \nfrom it through nose. Continuous upward and downward movement  of diaphragm is necessary \nto bring about the breathing. \n\nAlveoli\n\n11.1 Human Respiratory System and Alveoli\n\nRespiratory system\n\nRespiratory system : Structure and function\n\nLarynx\n\nBronchiolesTrachea\n\nNasal cavity\n\nPharynx\n\nLungs\n\nAlveoli\n\nAlveoli\n\nDiaphragm\n\nIn and out air \npassage\n\nRBCs\n\nTransport \ninto \ncapillaries\n\n\n\n77\n\nObserve the movements in the region \nbelow the thoracic cage, occurring during \nbreathing and discuss in the class. \n\n 1. What is meant by blood circulation? \n 2. Which organs are present in blood circulatory system? \n\nBlood circulatory system \n   Circulatory system performs the function of transport of various substances like water, \nhormones, oxygen, soluble nutrients, and waste materials through different organs. An \nindependent system  for blood circulation is present in  humans and higher animals. It consists  \nof heart, blood vessels and capillaries. \n\nHeart: Structure and  Functions \nHeart  is present almost at centre in \n\nthoracic cage. It is present behind the \nribs, between two lungs and slightly \ninclined on left side. \n\nSize of our heart is equal to one's \nown fist and its weight is about 360 \ngram. It is covered by a double layered \nperitoneal membrane. A fluid is present \nbetween  two membranes  due to which  \nheart is protected from friction and \nmechanical shocks. \n\nHuman heart is a muscular organ. \nIt is made up of involuntary cardiac \nmuscles. They contract and relax with a \ndefinite rhythm. This is called as beating \nof heart. \n\nInternally, heart is divided into left \nand right compartments  by a vertical \npartition. Each of those compartments \nis again divided into two chambers. \nThus, in all, heart consists of four \nchambers. Upper chambers are called \nas atria (singular - atrium) and lower \nchambers as ventricles.\n\n11.2 Breathing movements \n\nCan you recall?\n\nObserve and discuss.\n\n11.3 Structure of heart and blood circulation\n\nRight \npulmonary \nartery\n\nSuperior \nVena \ncava\n\nRight \npulmonary \nveins\n\nRight atrium \n\nInferior \nVena cava \n\nTricuspid \nvalve\n\nRight ventricle\n\nSemilunar valve \nof systemic aorta\n\nLeft \npulmonary \nartery\n\nSystemic aorta\n\nLeft atrium \n\nLeft \nventricle\n\nBicuspid \nValve\n\n\n\n78\n\nVeins : Vessels carrying the blood towards \nthe heart from various parts of body are \ncalled as veins. All veins except the one \ncarrying blood from lungs transport \ndeoxygenated blood. Most of the veins are \nsuperficially located in the body. Their walls \nare thin and these are provided with valves. \n\nCapillaries :  Arteries gradually branch  out  \nwith decrease in their diameter as they \nspread in the body and finally form fine hair-\nlike vessels  called as capillaries. Walls of \ncapillaries are extremely thin and made  up \nof single layer of cells. Due to this, exchange \nof materials between capillaries and cells \nbecomes easy. During the exchange, the \noxygen, nutrients, hormones, vitamins, etc. \nare sent towards the cells and waste materials \nof the cells move into blood. \n    Capillaries unite together to form the \nvessels of more diameter, called as veins. \nCapillary network is present in each organ. \n\nIn case of a healthy person, there are \n72 beats of heart per minute. Rate of \nheart beat increases due to physical \nexercise and emotions. Similarly, it has \nbeen observed that it decreases during \nrest and sleep. Number of beats is more \nin case of infants. \n\n Two types of sounds are heard \nduring heart beat. One is described as \n'lubb' and other as 'dub'. Heart pumps \nabout 75 ml of blood during each beat.\n\n11.5 Capillaries\n\nFrom the heart Toward the heart\n\nCapillaries\n\nArtery Vein\n\nIn History ...\n In 1628, William Harvey described \nthe mechanism of circulation in the body. \nHe proposed a theory that our heart is a \nmuscular pump by which blood is \ncirculated in the body. He discovered the \nworking mechanism of valves of the \nheart. \n\n11.4 Structure of Artery and Vein\n\nVein\n\nCapillary\n\nValve\nIntema\n\nMuscle\n\nConnective tissue\n\nArtery\n\nBlood vessels - Structure and functions : Heart is beating continuously. Due to this, blood \ncontinuously circulates through blood vessels. There are two main types of blood vessels.\nArteries : Blood vessels which carry the blood away  from heart are called as arteries. Except \nthe one carrying blood towards lungs, all carry oxygenated blood. These are deeply located in \nthe body and their walls are thick. These vessels do not have valves.\n\nWhy the veins are provided with valves?  Why the arteries have \nthick wall? \n\nDo you know?\n\nThink about it.\n\n\n\n79\n\nBlood circulation through heart / Functioning of Heart \nProcess of pumping the blood towards  various parts of the body and  bringing it back \n\ntowards the heart is called as blood circulation. So as to maintain the continuity in circulation, \nheart alternately contracts and relaxes. Consecutive single contraction and relaxation of heart \nconstitutes a single heart beat. \n\nMaterial :  Two feet long rubber tube with small aperture, stop watch, \nfunnel. \n\n1. Fit a funnel at one end of rubber tube. \n2. Keep the wide  mouth of funnel on left side of thorax. \n3. Bring the other end of tube near the ear to hear the sound. \n4. Record the number of beats per minute using stop watch. \n\nPulse : Find correlation between heart beats & pulses felt at wrist. \n\nBlood  \n    Blood is a red  colored fluid material. It is fluid connective tissue. The oxygenated blood is \ndeep red colored, salty in taste and its pH is 7.4. Blood is composed of mainly two components.\n\n1. We can feel the pulse behind the ears and near the heel of foot. \nHow these pulses occur? \n\n2. What flows out when we have an injury? \n\nCan you tell?\n\nTry this\n\nThink about it.\n\nPlasma                 Blood cells \n\nA. Plasma  is pale yellow, \nclear,   and  slightly alkaline \nfluid. It contains \n 90 -92 %  water \n 6 - 8 %  proteins  \n 1 - 2 %  inorganic salts\n and other components     \nB. Albumin - Distributes the \nwater all over the body. \nC. Globulins - Protection.      \nD. Fibrinogen & prothrombin  \nhelp in blood clotting \nprocess.    \nInorganic ions - Ca, Na, K - \ncontrol the function of \nmuscles and nerves.\n\n1. Red Blood Corpuscles (RBCs) \n Small, circular, enucleated cells. These cells appear  red \ndue  to  hemoglobin.  Oxygen dissolves in blood due to \nhemoglobin. \n  50 - 60 lakh RBCs  are present in each cubic millimeter of \nblood. RBCs are produced in red bone marrow and live for \nabout 100 - 127 days. \n2. White Blood Cells (WBCs) \n   These are large, nucleated and colorless cells. 5000-10000  \nWBCs  are present per mm3 of blood. \n- 5 types  of  WBCs are present - basophils, eosinophils,  \nneutrophils,   monocytes   & lymphocytes. \n- WBCs are produced in red bone marrow. \n- WBCs  act as soldiers in our body. \nFunction - These cells attack the pathogens entering our \nbody. They protect us from the microbial diseases. \n3. Platelets             \n- These are extremely small and disc-shaped.                  \n- 2.5 - 4 lakh platelets are present per mm3 of blood.                  \nFunction - Platelets participate in blood clotting process.\n\n \n\n\n\n80\n\nFunctions of Blood \n\n1. Transport  of gases : Oxygen  is carried via blood from lungs to cells in various parts \nof body and carbon dioxide from tissues to lungs. \n2. Transport  of nutrients : Simple nutrients like glucose, amino acids, fatty acids are \ntaken up by blood from wall of alimentary canal and transported up to each cell in the \nbody. \n3. Transport  of  waste materials :  Nitrogenous wastes like  ammonia, urea, creatinine \nare released by tissues into blood which carries those to kidney for excretion. \n4. Protection : Antibodies are produced in the blood and they protect the body from \nmicrobes and other harmful particles. \n5. Transport  of  enzymes and hormones :  Blood transports the enzymes  and  hormones \nfrom the site of their production to the site of their action. \n6. Thermoregulation :  Body  temperature  is maintained  constant at  37 0C by \nvasodilation and vasoconstriction. \n7. Maintaining the balance of minerals like Na, K in the body. \n8. If bleeding occurs at the injury, platelets and a protein called fibrinogen of the blood \n\nform a clot and seal the injury. \n\nHuman Blood Groups \n   Depending upon the proteins like antigens \nand antibodies, different blood groups are \nformed. There are four main groups of \nhuman blood as A, B, AB and O. Besides, \nthere are two types as 'Rh' negative and 'Rh' \npositive of each of those four groups. Thus, \nin all eight blood groups are formed. (Eg. A \nRh +ve & A Rh -ve). \nBlood Donation :  If a person meets an \naccident, bleeding occurs through wounds. \nMany times, blood transfusion is necessary \nduring the surgical operation. Similarly, \nblood is transfused in case of patients of \nanemia, thalassaemia, cancer too. Blood \ntransfusion is carried out to compensate the \nblood shortage in body. This is called as \nblood transfusion. \n\nFrom where the blood is supplied for blood \ntransfusion? \nBlood banks : Blood is collected in blood \nbanks by specific method from the healthy \npersons and supplied to the needful persons. \nIf the collected blood is not to be used \nimmediately, it can be stored for some days \nin refrigerator. \nBlood donor : Person who donates the blood \nis referred as blood donor. \nBlood recipient : Person who receives the \nblood is referred as recipient. \n   Person of the blood group 'O' can donate \nthe blood to the person having any other \nblood group where as the person with 'AB' \nblood group can receive the blood from the \nperson with any other blood group. Hence, \nperson of blood group 'O' is called as \nuniversal donor and the person with blood \ngroup 'AB' is called as universal recipient. \n\nBlood groups are hereditary and depend upon the genes inherited from parents. Blood \ntransfusion is performed only after the blood group matching. If it is done without matching, \nit may prove fatal for the patient. Person who donates the blood may be recipient in future. \nBlood donation without any expectation is always life saving. Blood is  required in various \nsituations like accidents, bleeding, parturition, surgical operations, etc. Blood donated by \nhealthy person is used to save the life of needful person. Hence blood donation is considered \nas the best donation.\n\n\n\n81\n\nBlood  Pressure : Blood  is continuously kept flowing through  blood vessels due to contraction-\nrelaxation of the heart. Due to contraction of the heart, pressure is exerted on the wall of \narteries and it is called as blood pressure. Proper  blood pressure is necessary to supply the \nblood in all parts of the body. Pressure recorded during the contraction of heart is called as \n'systolic pressure' and that one  recorded during relaxation is called as 'diastolic pressure'. \nBlood pressure of a healthy person is about 120/80 mm to 139/89 mm of Hg. It is measured \nwith the help of sphygmomanometer'. \n\nVisit the blood bank  in your area  and collect  more \ninformation about blood donation.\n\n* Blood production occurs continuously \nin our body. \n\n* About 350 ml of blood is collected from \na person during donation and  our body \nrestores the fluid part of it within 24 \nhrs. \n\n* Pregnant  and breast feeding  women \ncannot donate the blood. \n\n* There is no trouble during or after the \nblood donation. \n\n* 1st October is observed as National \nVoluntary Blood Donation Day.              \n\n* Healthy person of age more than 18 \nyears can donate the blood for 3 - 4 \ntimes a year.     \n           \n\nHypertension (High Blood Pressure) :\nHigh blood pressure than the normal is \nreferred as hypertension. In arteries of the \nperson with hypertension, unnecessary \ntension develops. Heart needs to perform \nmore function than the normal condition in \ncase of  hypertension.

Write the taste of lemon, sugar, curd, lime, baking soda, amla, \ntamarind, raw mango, pomegranate, water (sour, astringent, sweet, \nbitter, tasteless)\n\n12. Introduction to Acid & Base\n\nAcid\n You will notice that some substances \nhave sweet taste, some are bitter, some are \nsour or astringent. Lemon, tamarind, vinegar \nor amla like substances acquire sour taste \ndue to the presence of a typical compound in \nthem. Such compounds imparting sour taste \nare called acids. Acids are soluble in water \nand they are corrosive in nature. Animals \nand plants also possess acids in them.\n Acids present in food stuffs are called \nnatural acids or organic acids. These acids \nbeing weak in nature are called weak acids. \nSome acids are strong in nature. They are \ncaustic/inflammatory, e.g. sulphuric acid \n(H\n\n2\nSO\n\n4\n), hydrochloric acid (HCl) and nitric \n\nacid (HNO\n3\n). These acids are also called \n\n‘mineral acids’. The skin gets burnt when \ntheir concentrated solution falls on skin, \nsimilarly their vapours if inhaled can be \nharmful to health. Strong concentrated acids \nare converted into their dilute acids by slowly \nadding them into water. Such dilute acids \nare less harmful than their corresponding \nstrong acids.\n If you taste dilute solution of baking \nsoda, you will find it astringent/bitter. \nSubstances having astringent/bitter taste and \nslippery to touch e.g. Lime water [(CaOH)\n\n2\n], \n\nbaking soda (NaHCO\n3\n) caustic soda (NaOH) \n\nand soap are called bases. Bases are \ncompletely different from acids. Chemically \nthey have properties opposite to that of acids. \nThey are also inflammatory to skin in their \nconcentrated form. We know that the distilled \nwater is tasteless. Water is neither acidic nor \nbasic. \n\nIndicators in Laboratory :\n In the laboratory, litmus paper is \nmainly used to test alkali or base. This \npaper is made by an extract of licane \nplant. It is red or blue coloured. Blue \nlitmus paper turns red on dipping in acid \nand red litmus turns blue by alkali. \nSimilarly phenolphthalein, methyl \norange and methyl red are used in \nlaboratory in solution form. Methyl \norange indicator becomes pink in acid \nand yellow in alkali. Phenolphthalein \nremains colourless in acid and becomes \npink in alkali. Universal indicator which \nare in liquid state change their colour in \nthe presence of acid and base.\n\nIndicator :\nThe substances which are neither acidic \n\nnor basic and are chemically inert in nature. \nTouching or tasting of acid or base is very \nharmful and hence typical indicators are \nused to recognise them. The substances \nwhich change their colours in presence of \nacid or base are called ‘Indicators’. \n\n12.1 Laboratory indicators\n\nLitmus papers\n\nMethyl orange Phenolphthalein Methyl red\n\nCan you tell?\n\n\n\n84\n\nSr.No. Name of Indicator Colour of the Indicator Colour in Acid Colour in alkali\n\n1 Litmus paper Blue Red Blue (Remain same)\n2 Litmus paper Red Red (Remain \n\nsame)\nBlue\n\n3 Methyl orange Orange Pink Yellow\n4 Phenolphthalein Colourless Colourless Pink\n5 Methyl red Red Red Yellow\n\n12.2 : Indicators and their colours in acid and base\n\nDomestic Indicator : On non \navailability of laboratory \nindicator, ‘natural indicators’ \ncan be made by using several \ndomestic substances. You must \nhave seen yellow food stain \nturning red after washing with \nsoap. This colour change is a \nresult of chemical reaction \nbetween turmeric and alkaline \nmateiral of soap. Here turmeric \nacts as on indicator. Natural \nindicators can also be prepared \nfrom red cabbage, radish, \ntomato and similarly from \nhibiscus and rose.\n\nMaking of natural indicator :\n\nApparatus : Hibiscus, rose, turmeric, red cabbage \nleaves, filter paper etc.\nActivity : Rub red petals of hibiscus flower on the white \nfilter paper, This gives hibiscus indicator paper. Similarly \nrub, rose petals on the white filter paper. Cut strips of this \npaper, it is a rose indicator paper. Take turmeric powder, \nadd little water in it. Dip filter paper or ordinary paper in \nthe turmeric water for some time. After drying make \nstrips of that paper. Prepare turmeric indicator paper in \nthis way. Put leaves of red cabbage in small quantity of \nwater and heat it. Once solution of cabbage leaves cool \ndown, dip papers in it and dry it. Make strips of dried \npaper. In this way prepare red cabbage indicator paper.\n\n Put some drops of following substances on the indicator papers prepared by the \nabove method and write the effect in the following table.\n\nSr.No. Substance Effect on turmeric \npaper\n\nAcidic / basic\n\n1 Lime juice\n2 Lime water (calcium hydroxide)\n3 ...............\n\nTake baking powder. Add little water to it. Add this solution on to \nlime juice, vinegar, orange juice, apple juice, etc. and note the findings.\n\n What do you observe on addition of baking soda solution in the fruit juice? Whether \nbubbles formed or  effervescence came out of fruit juice?\n From the above first activity we came to know that turmeric indicator paper’s turns red \nyellow colour in certain solutions. Similarly on addition of baking soda solution in the acidic \nsolution bubbles come out or effervescence is produced. \n\nBy these simple and easy activity we can identify acidic or alkaline substance.\n\nTry this\n\nTry this\n\n\n\n85\n\n Under the guidance of teacher take vinegar, lime juice, ammonium \nhydroxide (NH\n\n4\nOH) and dil. hydrochloric acid (HCl) in different test-\n\ntubes. Add drops of following indicators in them. Also dip litmus papers \nin the solutions. Observe and record in the following table.\n\nSample solution Red litmus Blue litmus Phenolphthalein Methyl orange nature of solution\n(Acidic/Basic)\n\nLime juice\nNH4OH\n\nHCl\nVinegar\n\n1.

Which substances are used to clean \ngreenish stains on copper vessels and to \nshine blackish silver utensils?\n\n4. Why tooth-paste is used for brushing \nteeth?\n\nAcid \n Acid is such a substance which gives H+ \nions in solution state. e.g. HCl dissociates in \nwater solution.\n\nHCl (aq)       H+       +  Cl-\n\n(Hydrochloric acid)      (Hydrogen ion) (Chloride ion)\n\nExamples of some acids : Hydrochloric acid \n(HCl), Nitric acid (HNO\n\n3\n), Sulphuric acid \n\n(H\n2\nSO\n\n4\n), Carbonic acid (H\n\n2\nCO\n\n3\n)  (in cold \n\naerated drinks), ascorbic acid, citric acid in \nlemon and other fruits, acetic acid in vinegar, \netc.\n\nOur daily diet contains a few natural \n(organic) acids.

Orange colour of methyl \norange turns pink in acid while colourless \nphenolphthalein turns pink in alkali solution.\n\nCan you tell?\n\nTry this\n\n\n\n86\n\nThe iron knife shines better after cutting the sour fruits \nlike lemon, raw mangoes. Why?\n\nProperties of acid :\n1. Acids are sour in taste.\n2. Acid molecules contain hydrogen ion (H+) as \n\na main costituent.\n3. Acid reacts with metal to form hydrogen gas.\n4. Acid reacts with carbonates and liberates CO\n\n2\n \n\ngas.\n5. Blue litmus turns red in acid.\n\nUse of acids\n1. Acids are used in the production of chemical \n\nfertilizers.\n2. Acids are used in the production of explosives, \n\noil purification, medicines, dyes and paints.\n3. Hydrochloric acid is used for the preparation \n\nof different types of chloride salts.\n4. Dil. H\n\n2\nSO\n\n4\n acid is used in the batteries. \n\n(electric cell)\n5. Dil. HCl is used for sterilization of water.\n6. Acid is used for making of white paper from \n\nwood pulp.\n\nCausticity of concentrated acid \n\nand base : Dissolution of conc. \n\nH\n2\nSO\n\n4\n in water generates large \n\namout of heat. Therefore for \n\ndilution of concentrated acid, it is \n\nslowly added to water. Never add \n\nwater in the concentrated sulphuric \n\nacid. It will produce enormous \n\nheat and cause explosion.\n\n Bases like sodium hydroxide \n\nand potassium hydroxide are \n\nstrong and caustic in nature. Their \n\nconcentrated solution burns skin \n\nas it decomposes the proteins in \n\nskin.\n\n· We have seen that mineral acids are harmful to body. However serveral organic acids are \npresent in our body and in plants which are useful to us.\n\n· DNA (Deoxyribo Nucleic Acid) is an acid present in our body decides heredity property.\n· Proteins which are part of our body cell are made up of amino acids.\n· Fat of our body is formed by fatty acids.\nBase\n Base is a substance whose water solution gives hydroxide (OH-) ion e.g. \nNaOH (aq)   Na+(aq)  + OH- (aq) \n(Sodium Hydroxide)          (Sodium ion)      (Hydroxide ion)\n\n     Sodium Hydoxide       Potassium Hydroxide      Calcium Hydroxide       Magnesium Hydroxide   Ammonium Hydroxide\n\n12.5 Some examples of Base\n\nUse your brain power\n\n\n\n87\n\nSr.No. Name of Base Formula Use\n\n1 Sodium hydroxide/Caustic soda NaOH Washing soap\n\n2 Potassium hydroxide / Potash KOH Soap//shampoo\n\n3 Calcium hydroxide/lime water Ca(OH)\n2\n\nlime/white washing\n\n4 Magnesium hydroxide / milk of \nmagnesia\n\nMg(OH)\n2\n\nAcidity resistant medicines            \n(Antacids)\n\n5 Ammonium hydroxide NH\n4\nOH for production of fertilizers\n\n12.6 Table : Formulae of bases and their uses.\n\nProperties of alkalies :\n1. Bases has bitter taste.\n2. They are slippery.\n3. Bases contains hydroxide (OH-) as a main constituent.\n4. Metal oxides are generally basic in nature.\n\nNeutralization \n We have seen that acid contains (H+) hydrogen ions and base contains(OH-) hydroxide \nions. Salt and water are formed by combination of acid and base.\nAcid              +      Base      Salt               + Water\nHCl               +       NaOH   NaCl            +  H\n\n2\nO\n\n(Hydrochloric acid)             (Sodium hydroxide)     (Sodium chloride)     (Water)\n\nThis chemical reaction is called neutralization.\n\nRemember for identification of any substance it is dangerous to \ntaste, inhale or touch them.\n\nHydrochloric acid is present in our stomach. It helps to ease digestion process. \nHowever excessive acid leads to indigestion. Antacids are used to control this hyper \nacidity. This medicine contains milk of magnesia [Mg(OH)\n\n2\n]. Such alkaline medicine \n\nneutralises excess acid present in stomach.\nThe acidity of soil increases due to excessive use of chemical fertilizers. Under the \n\nguidance of agriculturist lime stone or lime water is mixed in the acidic soil. Such alkaline \nsubstances neutralizes excess acid present in the soil.\n\nAlways remember\n\nDo you know?\n\n\n\n88\n\n1.

Chemical Change and Chemical Bond\n\n1. What are the methods of classification of changes ? \n2. What is the difference between physical and chemical change ? \n3. Classify the follwing changes into physical and chemical change. \n\n13.1 Some observations of chemical change\n\nRipening of mango, melting of ice, boiling of water, dissolution of salt in water, Ripening \nof  banana, fragrance on ripening fruit, darkening of a cut potato, bursting of an inflated \nballoon, sound of bursting fire cracker, foul smell from a spoiled food. \n\nDuring any chemical change, composition of original substance changes to form new \nsubstance with a different composition and properties. How to identify a chemical change?\n\nTake the lemon juice in a clean glass. \nTake two drops of the lemon juice in a spoon \nand taste. Add a pinch of baking soda in the \nglass of lemon juice. Did you notice bubbling \naround the particles of soda? Did you hear a \nsound on taking your ear near the glass? \nNow again taste it. Did it taste as sour as it \nwas in the beginning?(Above activity is to \nbe done using clean apparatus and edible \nmaterial. Then only it is possible to test \nthe 'taste', otherwise keep in mind that \nthe testing of 'taste' cannot be done.) \n\nMany perceivable observations are \nnoticed during the above activity. A gas is \nseen to be liberating in the form of bubbles. \nA low sound is heard. The white solid \nparticles of the baking soda disappear. The \noriginal sour taste becomes mild or \ndiminishes. From this, it is understood that a \nnew substance  having a different taste is \nformed. At the end of the above change, the \ntaste of the substance was different means its \ncomposition was different. Thus, during the \nabove change, the composition of the original \nsubstance changed to form a new substance \nwith different properties. Thus, the change \nthat takes place on adding baking soda to \nlemon juice is a chemical change. Sometimes \nsome characteristic observations are \nperceived during a chemical change. These \nenable us to know that a chemical change \nhas taken place. Some of these observations \nare enlisted in the table 13.1\n\nChange in colour, taste, release of gases, etc\n\nCan you recall?\n\nTry this\n\n\n\n90\n\nFirst step of writing a chemical equation is to write a word equation by using the names of \nthe concerned substances. When the chemical formula is written in place of each of the names, it \nbecomes a chemical equation. While writing a chemical equation, original substances are written \non the left side and newly formed substances are written on right side and an arrow is drawn in \nbetween. Arrow head points towards the substances formed. Arrow indicates the direction of the \nreaction. Substances written on the left side of the arrow are original substances that take part in \nthe reaction. They are called reactants. New substances formed as a result of the reaction are \ncalled products. Place for the products of a reaction is on the right side of the arrow.\n\nChemical change and word equation : During a chemical \nchange the chemical composition of the original matter changes \nand new substances having different properties and different \nchemical compositon are formed. A chemical equation can be \nwritten for a chemical change, if the exact change in chemical \ncomposition is known. Names and chemical formulae of the \noriginal substance and newly formed substance are used while \nwriting a chemical equation. For example, when baking soda is \nadded to lemon juice a chemical change takes place in the citric \nacid present in the lemon juice and the gas formed is carbon \ndioxide. The word equation can be written for this chemical \nreaction  as follows\nCitric acid  + Sodium bicarbonate     Carbon dioxide + Sodium citrate\n     Acid       +          Alkali                              CO\n\n2                    \n+         Salt  \n\nThis is neutralization reaction.\n\nNatural chemical changes  \na. Respiration : Respiration is a continuously \noccuring biological process. In this process, \nwe inhale the air and exhale carbon dioxide \nand water vapour. After an in depth study it \nis learnt that glucose in the cells reacts with \noxygen in the inhaled air to form carbon \ndioxide and water. The word equation and \nthe chemical equation of this chemical \nreaction are as follows. (Here, the chemical \nequation is not balanced.)\nWord equation : \nGlucose + Oxygen \n\nrespiration\n Carbon dioxide + Water\n\nChemical equation :\n\nC\n6\nH\n\n12\nO\n\n6\n  +  O\n\n2\n  \n\nrespiration\n     CO\n\n2\n + H\n\n2\nO\n\nChemical changes in everyday life : We find many examples of chemical changes in our \nsurrounding, body, home and laboratory. Let us see some chemical changes for which word \nand chemical equation can be written easily.\n\nAlways remember\n\nTry this\n\nFormation of CO\n2 \nwith \n\neffervescence\n\n13.2 Experiment figure\n\nTake some freshly prepared lime water \n(solution of calcium hydroxide) in a test tube. \nKeep on blowing in it with a blow tube. What \nis seen after some time? Did the colourless \nlime water turn milky? After some more time \nyou will find that a white insoluble solid settles \nat the bottom of the test tube. This is a \nprecipitate of calcium carbonate. The turning \nmilky millgot lime water means that the blown \ngas mixed in it was carbon dioxide. \nCarbon \n\n+ \n   Calcium    Calcium\n\ndioxide      hydroxide         carbonate + Water \nWrite a chemical equation for the above word \nequation.  \n\n\n\n91\n\nb. Photosynthesis : You know that green plants perform photosynthesis in sunlight. A word \nequation and a chemical equation (unbalanced) can be written for this natural chemical \nchange as follows.\n\nWord equation : Carbon dioxide + Water \nSunlight\n\ngreen plant\n       Glucose + Oxygen \n\n       \nChemical equation : CO\n\n2\n  + H\n\n2\nO \n\nSunlight\n\ngreen plant\n  C\n\n6\nH\n\n12\nO\n\n6\n + O\n\n2\n\n                           \nManmade chemical changes : We bring about many chemical changes for our use in \neveryday life. Let us see some of them. The chemical change that we saw in the first activity \nis used in the cold drink called 'soda-lemon'. It means that it is an useful manmade chemical \nchange. \na. Combustion of fuels : Wood, coal, petrol or cooking gas are burnt for getting energy. The \ncommon substance that burns in all these fuels is 'Carbon'. During the combustion process \ncarbon combine with oxygen in air and the product carbon dioxide is formed. A common \nequation can be written for all these combustion processes as follows.\n\nWord equation : Carbon + Oxygen    Carbon dioxide \n\nChemical equation : C + O\n2\n   CO\n\n2\n\nCombustion of fuel is a fast and irreversible chemical change.\n\nb. Cleaning Shahabad tile with dilute hydrochloric acid : The chemical composition of \nShahabad tile is mainly calcium carbonate. During its cleaning with hydrochloric acid the \nupper layer of the tile reacts with hydrochloric acid and three products are formed. One of \nthem is calcium chloride, which being soluble in water, gets washed away with water. The \nsecond product is carbon dioxide; its bubbles mix up in air. The third product, water mixes \nwith water. The following equation can be written for this chemical change. \n\nWord equation :  \nCalcium cabonate + Hydrochloric acid  Calcium chloride + Carbon dioxide + water\n\nWrite a chemical equation (unbalanced) for the above reaction.\n\nc. Softening of hard water : Some wells or tube wells have hard water. It is brackish to taste \nand does not form lather with soap. This is because of hard water contains the chloride and \nsulphate salts of calcium and magnesium in dissolved state. To soften the hard water, a \nsolution of washing soda is added to it. This results in a chemical reaction to form a precipitate \nof insoluble carbonate salts of calcium and magnesium. As the dissolved salts of calcium and \nmagnesium go out in the form of precipitate of the carbonate salts, the water is softened. The \nfollowing equation can be written for this chemical change.\n\nWord equation : \nCalcium chloride  + Sodium carbonate   Calcuim carbonate+ Sodium chloride \n\nChemical equation (unbalanced) : \nCaCl\n\n2\n + Na\n\n2\nCO\n\n3\n   CaCO\n\n3 \n+ NaCl\n\nWrite word and chemical equations for the chemical change taking place in magnesium \nsalts during the softening of hard water.\n\n\n\n92\n\n13.3 Formation of Ionic bond of NaCl\n11\n\nNa              +        \n17\n\nCl                    Na+Cl- \n\nWe saw that composition of matter changes during a chemical change and new substances \nhaving different properties are formed. When this happens, some chemical bonds in the \nreactants break and new substances called products are formed by formation of new chemical \nbonds. We have also seen in the chapter 'Composition of Matter' that the number of chemical \nbonds formed by one atom is its valency. Now let us see what is a chemical bond. \n\nChemical bond : We have seen the relationship between electronic configuration and valency \nof an element in the chapter 'Inside the Atom'. Noble gases do not form any chemical bond as \ntheir electron octet/duplet is complete while the atoms with incomplete electron octet/duplet \nform chemical bonds. Reason for this is that an atom uses its valence electrons during \nformation of a chemical bond. Moreover on forming chemical bonds equal to its valency the \natom attains the electronic configuration of complete octet/duplet. \n\n1. Ionic bond : Let us first see how the \ncompound sodium chloride is formed from \nthe atoms of the constituent elements sodium \nand chlorine. For this purpose let us see the \nelectronic configuration of sodium and \nchlorine.\n \n11\n\nNa :  2,8,1;    \n17\n\nCl  : 2,8,7\nWe have seen the correlation that the \n\nvalency of sodium is one as it has one \nelectron in its valence shell and the valency \nof chlorine is one as its valence shell is short \nof one electron to have  a complete octet. On \nloss of a valence electron from ‘M’shell, the \npenultimate shell ‘L’ of sodium atom \nbecomes outermost shell. It has eight \nelectrons in it. Effectively, sodium attains an \nelectron octet state. However, the electron \nnumber, becomes 10. Hence the positive \ncharge +11 on the sodium nucleus is \nimbalanced and a Na+ cation, carrying net \npositive charge +1 is formed. On the other \nhand valence shell of chlorine atom contains \nan electron less to the octet state. On \naccepting an electron from outside, octet of \nchlorine is completed. However the charge \nbalance is disturbed due to additon of an \nelectron to the neutral chlorine atom. This \nresults in the formation of an anion Cl-, \ncarrying a net negative charge -1. \n\nWhen the elements sodium and chlorine \ncombine, an atom of sodium gives its valence \nelectron to a chlorine atom, whereby the \ncations  Na+ and anions Cl- are formed. Due \nto the electrostatic force of attraction between \nopposite charges the oppositely charged ions \nget attracted to each other and a chemical \nbond is formed between them.\n\n The chemical bond formed due to an \nelctrostatic force of attraction between the \noppositely charged cation and anion is called \nan ionic bond or an electrovalent bond. \nThe compound formed by means of one or \nmore ionic bonds is called ionic compound.\n\nFormation of an ionic compound sodium \nchloride from the elements sodium and \nchlorine is shown with the help of diagramatic \nrepresentation of electronic configuration in \nthe fig 13.3. \n\nOne ionic bond is formed due to the \nelectrical charge +1 or -1 on an ion. The \nvalency of an ion is equal to the magnitude \nof postive or negative charge on it. An ion \nforms the same number of ionic bonds as its \nvalency. \n\n\n\n93\n\n13.4 Formation of Ionic bond in MgCl\n2 \nmolecule\n\n                        17\nCl         +    \n\n12\nMg         +   \n\n17\nCl                   Cl- Mg2+ Cl-\n\n                  2,8,7                   2,8,2                  2,8,7                                 2,8,8    2,8      2,8,8\n\n13.6 Formation of Covalent bond in H\n2\nO molecule\n\nThe figure 13.4 shows how the ionic compound magnesium chloride is formed from the \nelements magnesium and chlorine.\n\nShow the formation of the following ionic compounds from the corressponding elements \nusing two methods namely, numerical and diagramatic representation of electronic \nconfiguration. (a)   K+F-, from \n\n19\nK  and \n\n9\nF   (b) Ca2+O2- from \n\n20\nCa and  \n\n8\nO\n\n2. Covalent bond : Generally a covalent \nbond is formed when atoms of two elements \nhaving similar properties combine. Such \natoms cannot exchange electrons. Instead, \nthese atoms share electrons with each other. \nThe shared electrons become a common \nproperty of both the atoms and thereby the \nelectron octet/duplet of both the atoms \nbecomes complete. Let us first consider an \nexample of the hydrogen molecule (H\n\n2\n). \n\n We have seen in the chapter 'Inside \nan Atom' that a hydrogen atom contains one \nelectron, its duplet is short of one electron \nand therefore the valency of hydrogen is one. \nThe two atoms of hydrogen are identical and \n\nhave similar tendency and therefore they \nshare their electrons with each other. As a \nresult, the electron duplet of both the \nhydrogen atoms is complete and a chemical \nbond is formed between them.\n\nThe chemical bond formed by sharing \nof valence electrons of two atoms with each \nother is called a covalent bond. One covalent \nbond is formed by sharing of two valence \nelectron. The figure 13.5 shows formation of \nthe H\n\n2\n molecule from two hydrogen atoms, \n\nusing diagramatic representation of elctronic \nconfiguration. A covalent bond between two \natoms is also represented by dash joining \ntheir symbols. \n\nNow let us see how an  H\n2\nO molecule of a covalent compound is formed from hydrogen \n\nand oxygen atoms. (See fig. 13.6) There are six electrons in the valence shell of oxygen atom. \nIt means that the electron octet in oxygen is short of two electrons and the valency of oxygen \nis ‘2’. In the H\n\n2\nO molecule the oxygen atom completes its octet by forming two covalent \n\nbonds, one each with the two hydrogen atoms. While this happens, the duplets of the two \nhydrogen atoms also are completed. \n\nH o H H2O\n\n13.5 Formation of Covalent bond in H\n2 \nmolecule\n\nH H H2\n\n\n\n94\n\n1.

Which sources do we get heat from?\n 2. How is heat transferred?\n 3. Which effects of heat do you know?\nSome effects of heat are shown in figure 14.1 \nWhat are they?\n We have seen in previous standards that \nheat is a form of energy which flows from an \nobject at high temperature to an object at \nlow temperature. Temperature of an object \ntells us how hot or cold that object is. The \ntemperature of a cold object is lower than the \ntemperature of a hot object. Thus, the \ntemperature of ice cream is less than the \ntemperature of tea. 14.1 Various effects of heat\n\n We have also seen that when we give heat to an object it expands and it contracts on \ncooling. Also, the state of matter changes due to heat.\n The unit of heat in SI system is Joule while that in CGS units is calorie. One calorie is \nequivalent to 4.18 Joule. One calorie heat is the heat required to increase the temperature of 1 \ngm of water through 10C.\n\nSolved examples\n1. How much heat will be needed to raise the \ntemperature of 1.5 kg of water from 15 0C to \n45 0C ? Give the answer in calories as well as \nin Joule.\nGiven : mass of water = 1.5 kg = 1500 gm. \nChange in temperature = 45 0C - 15 0C                   \n= 30 0C. \nHeat required for temperature change = ?\nHeat required for temperature change = mass \nof water (gm) x change in temperature (0C) \ncal.\n= 1500 ´ 30 cal = 45000 cal\n= 45000 ´ 4.18 J = 188100 J\n2. If the temperature of water changes by       \n10 0C on giving 300 cal of heat, what is the \nmass of water?\nGiven : Amount of heat given to water = 300 \ncal, change in temperature = 10 0C, mass of \nwater = m = ?\nAmount of heat given (cal) = mass of water \n(gm) x change in temperature (0C) \n300 = m ´ 10\nm = 300 / 10 = 30 gm.\n\nSources of heat\n1. Sun : The Sun is the biggest source of heat \nreceived by the earth. A large amount of heat \nis generated due to the nuclear fusion taking \nplace in its centre. In this process hydrogen \nnuclei fuse together to form helium nuclei, \ngenerating heat in the process. Some of it \nreaches the earth in the form of light and \nheat.\n2. Earth : As the temperature at the centre of \nthe earth is high, the earth is also a source of \nheat. This heat is called geothermal energy.\n3. Chemical energy : When fuels like wood, \ncoal, petrol etc, burn, there is chemical \nreaction between the fuel and oxygen. Heat \nis generated in these reactions. \n4. Electrical Energy : In your daily life, you \nhave seen several equipments which produce \nheat with the help of electricity e.g. electric \npress, electric heater etc. Thus, electricity is \na source of heat.\n\nCan you recall?\n\n14. Measurement and Effects of Heat\n\n\n\n96\n\n5. Atomic energy :  A huge amount of heat is produced in a very short time when the nuclei \nof some elements like uranium, thorium etc undergo fission. This is used in atomic energy \nprojects.\n6. Air : A large amount of heat is present in the air around us. \n\nTemperature : We can find out how hot or cold an object is by touching the object. However, \nour sense of ‘hot’ or ‘cold’ is relative. This can be understood from the following experiment.\n\n14.2 Relative sensation\n\n1. Take three similar vessels. Let us call \nthem ‘A’, ‘B’and ‘C’(see figure 14.2 )\n\n2. Fill A with hot water and B with cold \nwater. Put some water from A and B in C.\n\n3.  Dip your right hand in A and left hand in \nB, and keep them immersed for 2 to 3 \nminutes.\n\n4.  Now dip both the hands in C. What do \nyou feel?\n\nHot gas Cooler gas\n\n Even though, both the hands are dipped in water in the same vessel i.e. water at the same \ntemperature, your right hand will find the water to be cold while the left hand will find it to be \nhot. What is the reason for this? Think about it.\n You must have understood from the above activity that we cannot determine the \ntemperature of an object accurately by simply touching it. Also you may hurt yourself by \ntouching very hot or cold objects. So we feel the need of some device for measuring temperature. \nThermometer is a device for measuring temperature. You have read about thermometer in the \nprevious class. In this lesson you are going to learn about the construction of a thermometer.\n\nWhat are potential and kinetic energies? \n\nHeat and Temperature : What is the difference \nbetween heat and temperature? We know that a \nsubstance is made of atoms. The atoms in a substance \nare always in motion. The total kinetic energy of the \natoms in a substance is a measure of the heat contained \nin that substance, while the temperature of a substance \nis related to the average kinetic energy of atoms. If the \naverage kinetic energy of atoms in two objects is equal \nthen their temperatures will also be equal.\n Figure 14.3 ‘a’and ‘b’ show the velocities of atoms \nin a gas at high and low temperature, respectively. The \ndirection and the length of the arrows attached to the \natoms show the direction and magnitude of the velocity \nof the atoms. The velocity of atoms in the gas at higher \ntemperature is larger than the velocity of atoms in the \ngas at lower temperature. \n\n14.3 Motion of atoms in gas and \nsolid\n\nVessel A Vessel C Vessel B\n\n(a) (b)\n\n(c)\n\nTry this\n\nCan you recall?\n\nSolid\n\nAtom\n\n\n\n97\n\nThe velocities of atoms in a solid object are shown by arrows in figure 14.3(c). The atoms \nin a solid object are tied to one another because of the forces acting between them. So they \ncannot be displaced from their places. Because of heat, they oscillate around their fixed \nposition. Higher the temperature of the solid, faster is their velocity of oscillation.\n\nSuppose A and B are two objects made from the same substance. The mass of A is twice \nthe mass of B which means that the number of atoms in A is twice the number of atoms in B. \nEven if the temperatures of A and B are equal, i.e. the average kinetic energy of atoms in A is \nsame as that in B, the total kinetic energy of atoms in A is twice that in B. Thus, the heat \ncontent of A is twice that of B even though, they both have the same temperature.\n\n1. Take two steel vessels A and B of the same size.\n\n2. Fill some water in A and double that amount in B. Make sure that the water in both vessels \nare at the same temperature.\n3. Raise the temperatures of water in both vessels by 10 0 C using a spirit lamp. Did it take the \nsame time to increase the temperature in the two vessels?\n You must have required more time to raise the temperature of water in B. This means that \nfor the same increase in temperature, you had to give more amount of heat to B. Thus, even \nthough the water in A and B have the same temperature, the amount of heat in B is more than \nthat in A.\n Temperature is measured in units of Celsius (0C), Fahrenheit (0F) and Kelvin (K). Kelvin \nis used in scientific experiments, while the other two are used in daily life. The relation between \n\nthe three units is shown by the following formulae.\n\n(F-32)\n9\n\n= C\n5\n\n --------(1) \n\n K = C + 273.15        -------(2)\n Some specific temperatures are given in \nthe three scales in the following table. Verify \nthat they satisfy the above relations and fill \nappropriate numbers in the blanks.\n\nDescription 0F 0C K\n\nBoiling point of water 212 100 373.15\n\nFreezing point of water 32 0 273\n\nRoom temperature 72 23 296\n\nBoiling point of mercury 356.7\n\nFreezing point of mercury -38.8\n\nSloved examples\n1. How much will the temperature of 68 0F be in Celsius and Kelvin?\nGiven : Temperature in Fahrenheit = F = 68, Temperature in Celsius = C= ?,\nTemperature in Kelvin = K = ?\n\nAccording to formula (1),  (F-32)\n9\n\n= C\n5\n\n (68-32)\n9\n\n= C\n5\n\nC = 5 x 36\n9\n\n= 20 0C  According to formula (2)\n\nK = C + 273.15 = 20 + 273.15 = 293.15\nThus, the temperature in Celsius = 20 0C and in Kelvin = 293.15 K\n\nTry this\n\n\n\n98\n\n2. At what temperature will its value be same in Celsius and in Fahrenheit?\nGiven : If the temperature in Celsius is C, then the temperature in Fahrenheit (F) will be same, \ni.e. F= C.\n\nUsing formula (1),  (F-32)\n9\n\n= C\n5\n\nor,  (C-32)\n9\n\n= C\n5\n\n(C-32) ´ 5 = C ´ 9\n5C - 160 = 9 C\n4 C = - 160\nC = F = - 40 The temperatures in Celsius and in Fahrenheit will be same at - 400\n\nThermometer : You must have seen the \nthermometer that is used when someone at \nhome has fever. That thermometer is called \nclinical thermometer. Different thermometers \nare used for different purposes. Let us first \nlearn about the working of a thermometer.\n A thermometer is shown in figure 14.4 \na. It has a narrow glass tube which has a \nbulb at one end. The bulb and part of the tube \nis filled with a liquid. Earlier, mercury was \nused but, as it is harmful for us, it has been \nreplaced with alcohol. The rest of the volume \nof the tube has vacuum and its other end is \nclosed. The bulb is kept in contact with the \nobject whose temperature is to be measured \nso that its temperature becomes same as that \nof the object. Because of the increased \ntemperature the alcohol inside it expands \nand its level in the tube rises. Using the \nproperties of the expansion of alcohol (to be \ndiscussed below), the temperature can be \nobtained from the level of the alcohol. The \ntube of the thermometer is marked \naccordingly.\n Figure 14.4 (b) shows a clinical \nthermometer. As the body temperature of a \nhealthy person is 37 0C, clinical thermometers \nare designed to measure temperatures \nbetween 35 0C and 42 0C. These days, instead \nof the above type, digital thermometers are \nused for clinical puroses. One such \nthermometer is shown in figure 14.4 c. \n\n14.4 : Different thermometers\n\nThis does not use the expansion of liquid due \nto heat. Instead, it has a sensor which can \nmeasure the heat coming out from the body \ndirectly and from that can measure the \ntemperature of the body.\n The thermometers used in laboratory \nare similar to the one shown in figure 14.4 a \nexcept that the range of temperatures that it \ncan measure is large spanning 40 0C to          \n110 0C or even larger. A special type of \nthermometer is used to measure the minimum \nand maximum temperatures in a day. It is \ncalled the maximum minimum thermometer. \nIt is shown in figure 14.4 d.\n\nc. Digital \nthermometer\n\nd. Maximum \n- minimum \nthermometer\n\na. A thermometer\n\nb. Clinical \nthermometer\n\n\n\n99\n\n When a hot object is kept in contact with a cold object they both exchange heat. The hot \nobject gives away heat while the cold object absorbs heat. Thus, temperature of the hot object \ndecreases, while that of the cold object increases. This means that the kinetic energy of atoms \nin the cold object goes on incresing while that in the hot object goes on decreasing. A time \ncomes when the average kinetic energies of atoms in both objects become equal, which means \nthat the temperatures of both objects become equal.\nSpecific heat : The specific heat of an object is the amount of heat required to increase the \ntemperature of unit mass of that substance through one degree. This is represented by the \nsymbol ‘c’. Its unit in SI is Joule /(kg 0C) and in CGS is cal/(gm 0C). Suppose Q amount of \nheat is required to increase the temperature of an object of mass m and specific heat c, from \nT\n\ni\n to T\n\nf\n This amount depends on the mass and specific heat of the object as well as on the \n\nincrease in temperature and can be written as.\nQ = m x c x (T\n\nf\n - T\n\ni\n)....................... (3)\n\n Different substances have \ndifferent specific heats. We are going \nto learn more about it in future classes. \nThe specific heats of a few substance \nare given in the following table.\n\nSubstances Specific heat\ncal/(gm 0C) \n\nSubstance Specific heat\ncal/(gm 0C) \n\nAluminium 0.21 Iron 0.11\n\nAlcohol 0.58 Copper 0.09\n\nGold 0.03 Mercury 0.03\n\nHydrogen 3.42 Water 1.0\n\nCalorimeter : We have seen that a \nthermometer is used to measure the \ntemperature of an object. A calorimeter is \nused to measure the heat content of an object. \nUsing this equipment, we can measure the \nheat produced or absorbed in a physical or \nchemical process.\n A calorimeter is shown in figure 14.5 \nSimilar to a thermosflask, a calorimeter has \ntwo vessels, an inner and an outer one. This \nway, no heat can be transferred from the \ninner to the outer vessel or from the outer to \nthe inner vessel. Thus, the inner vessel is \nthermally isolated from the surroundings. \nThe inner vessel is made of copper. A \nthermometer for measuring the temperature \nand a stirrer for stirring the liquid in the \ncalorimeter are fitted in it.\n\n1. Why does your mother put folded cloth \nstrips soaked in cold water on your \nforehead when you have high fever?\n\n2. Why is the calorimeter made of copper?\n\n Water at a fixed temperature is placed \ninside the calorimeter. This means that the \ntemperature of the inner vessel and that of \nthe water in it are the same. When a hot \nobject is placed in water, heat is exchanged \nbetween the hot object, water and the \ncalorimeter and all three reach the same \ntemperature. As the calorimeter is thermally \nisolated from the surroundings, the total heat \nlost by the hot object is equal to the total heat \nabsorbed by the calorimeter and water inside \nit.\n Similarly if we put a cold object in the \ncalorimeter, the cold object will receive heat \nfrom the water and its temperature will \nincrease, while water and calorimeter will \nlose heat and their temperature will decrease.\n Suppose the mass of the inner vessel in \nthe calorimeter is ‘m\n\nc\n’ and its initial \n\ntemperature is ‘T\ni\n’and the mass of the water \n\nin the calorimeter is ‘m\nw\n’. The temperature \n\nof water will also be ‘T\ni\n’ . Suppose we place \n\nan object of mass ‘m\nO\n’ and temperature ‘T\n\no\n’ \n\nin the calorimeter. If ‘T\no\n’ is higher than T\n\ni\n the \n\nobject will give away heat to the calorimeter \nand water. Soon the temperature of all three \nwill become the same. \n\nUse your brain power\n\n\n\n100\n\nLet us call this final temperature ‘T\nf\n’ . The \n\ntotal heat given away by the object (‘Q\no\n’) \n\nwill be equal to the sum of the heat gained by \nthe calorimeter (‘Q\n\nc\n’) and by water (‘Q\n\nw\n’). \n\nWe can write this as.\n\nQ\no \n= Q\n\nC \n+ Q\n\nW \n........................... (4)\n\n As seen above Q\no\n, Q\n\nc \nand Q\n\nw \ndepend on \n\nmass, specific heat and change in temperature \nDT. If the specific heats of the material of \ncalorimeter, water and the object are c\n\nc \n, c\n\nw \n\nand c\no \n\nrespectively, we can write using \nformula (3), \n\nQ\nO\n = m\n\nO\n ´ DT\n\nO\n ´  C\n\nO\n,      DT\n\nO\n = T\n\nO\n – T\n\nf\n\nQ\nW\n\n = m\nW\n\n ´ DT\nW\n\n ´  C\nW\n\n,   DT\nW\n\n = T\nf\n – T\n\ni\n\nQ\nC\n = m\n\nC\n ´ DT\n\nC\n ´  C\n\nC\n,    DT\n\nC\n = T\n\nf\n – T\n\ni\n = DT\n\nW \n\nUsing (4),  m\no \n´ DT\n\no \n´  c\n\no \n= m\n\nw\n ´   DT\n\nw \n´  c\n\nw \n+ m\n\nc  \n´  DT\n\nc \n´ c\n\nc \n ............................ (5)\n\n We can measure all the masses and temperatures. If we know the specific heats of the \nmaterial of the calorimeter i.e. copper and that of water, we can calculate the value of the \nspecific heat of the object using formula (5). We will learn about this in more details in higher \nstandards.\n\nSolved Examples\n\n1. Suppose the masses of the calorimeter, the water in it and the hot object made up of copper \nwhich is put in the calorimeter are the same. The initial temperature of the calorimeter and \nwater is 30 0C and that of the hot object is 60 0C. The specific heats of copper and water are \n0.09 cal / (gm 0C) and 1 cal / (gm 0C) respectively. What will be the final temperature of \nwater?\nGiven :  m\n\nw \n= m\n\no \n= m\n\nc \n= m,\n\n \n T\n\ni \n= 30 oC,\n\n \n T\n\no \n= 60 oC\n\n, \nT\n\ni \n= ?\n\nUsing formula (5), m ´  (60 - T\nf \n) ´  0.09 = m ´  (T\n\nf \n- 30) ´  1 + m ´ (T\n\nf  \n- 30) ´  0.09 \n\n(60 - T\nf \n) ´  0.09 = (T\n\nf \n - 30) ´  1.09\n\n60 ´  0.9 + 30 ´  1.09 = (0.09 + 1.09) T\ni\n\nT\n1\n = 32.29 0C\n\nThe final temperature of water wil be 32.29 0C.\n\nEffects of heat\n In previous standards, we have studied two effects of heat on matter : 1. expansion and \ncontraction and 2. change of state. In this lesson, we are going to learn more about expansion. \nYou will learn about change of state of matter in higher standards.\n\nExpansion\n When heat is given to any substance, its temperature increases and it expands. Its \nexpansion depends on the increase in its temperature. Solids, liquids and gases, all expand on \nreceiving heat.\n\nHeat\nresistant\nring\n\nOuter \nvessel\n\nInner \nvessel\n\nStirrer\n\n14.5 Caloriemeter\n\nAir\ncavity\n\nThermometer\n\nHeat resistant lid\n\n\n\n101\n\nExpansion of solids\nLinear expansion : The linear expansion of \na solid is the increase in length of a wire or a \nrod of a solid due to increase in its \ntemperature.\nWhen we increase the temperature of a rod \nof length l\n\n1\n from T\n\n1\n to T\n\n2\n, its length becomes \n\nl\n2\n. The change in length is proportional to the \n\noriginal length and the increase in \ntemperature, (D T=T\n\n2 \n- T\n\n1\n). So we can write \n\nthe change in length as follows.\nChange in length a original length x change \nin temperature\nl\n2 \n- l\n\n1 \na l\n\n1 \n´ DT\n\nl\n2 \n- l\n\n1 \n= l  ´ l\n\n1 \n´ DT\n\n \n................... (6)\n\nl\n2 \n= l\n\n1 \n(1+ lDT) ......................... (7)\n\nHere l  (lambda) is the constant of \nproportionality and it is called the \ncoefficient of linear expansion of the \nsolid substance. \n\nThe expansion coefficients of different \nsubstances are different. From the above \nformula we can see that if we take two rods \nof different substances, both having the same \nlength, and increase their temperatures by \nthe same amount, the rod of the substance \nhaving higher expansion coefficient will \nexpand more. Thus, the increase in its length \nwill be larger.\n\nFrom formula (6), we can write the \nexpansion coefficient as\nl = (l\n\n2  \n-  l\n\n1\n) / (l\n\n1 \nDT) ..................... (8)\n\nThus, the expansion coefficient is the \nchange in length of a rod of unit length when \nits temperature is increased by 1 degree. \nFrom formula (8) we can see that the unit of \nexpansion coefficient is the inverse of the \nunit of temperature, i.e. 1/0C. The expansion \ncoefficients of some substances are given in \nthe following table. \n\nSolid Coefficient \nof linear \nexpansion x \n106 (1/0C)\n\nLiquid Coefficient \nof volume \nexpansion x \n103 (1/0C)\n\nGas Expansion coefficient \nx 103 (1/0C)\n\nCopper 17 Alcohol 1.0 Hydrogen 3.66\n\nAluminium 23.1 Water 0.2 Helium 3.66\n\nIron 11.5 Mercury 0.2 Nitrogen 3.67\n\nSilver 18 Chloroform 1.3 Sulphur dioxide 3.90\n\n14.6  : Coefficient of expansion of some substances\nSolved Examples\n\nExample : What will be the increase in length of a steel rod of length 0.5 m, when its \ntemperature is increased by 60 0C? The coefficient of linear expansion of steel is                                   \n0.000013 (1/0C).\nGiven : Initial length of the rod = 0.5 m, change in temperature = 60 0C, change in length = \nDl = ? \nUsing formula (6), Dl = l ´ l\n\n1\n ´ DT = 0.000013 ´ 0.5 ´ 60 = 0.00039 m\n\nIncrease in length = 0.039 cm\nAreal expansion of solids : Similar to linear expansion, the area of a sheet of a solid material \nalso increaes on heating. This is called the areal expansion of solids. This is given by the \nfollowing formula.\nA\n\n2 \n= A\n\n1  \n(1 + s DT) .............................

This is called the volumetric \nexpansion of a solid. This is given by the following formula.\nV\n\n2 \n= V\n\n1  \n(1 + b DT) ............................. (10) Here, DT is the change in temperature and and V\n\n1  \nand V\n\n2  \nare the initial and final volumes of the solid. b is the volumetric expansion coefficient \n\nof the solid.\n\n\n\n102\n\nHave you seen rails? They are not \ncontinuous. A small gap is kept between them \nat regular intervals. This is shown in the figure. \nThis is kept to accommodate the change in the \nlength of the rails with change in temperature. \nIf this gap is not kept, then the rails will get \ndistroted due to expansion in summer which \nmay lead to accidents.\n\nExpansion of liquids\nA liquid does not have a definite shape but it \nhas a definite volume. So we can define a \nvolumetric expansion coefficient for a liquid \nas follows.\nV\n\n2 \n= V\n\n1  \n(1 + b DT) ............................. (11)\n\nHere, DT is the change in temperature and \nV\n\n1 \nand V\n\n2 \nare the initial and final volumes of \n\nthe liquid. b is the volumetric expansion \ncoefficient of the liquid.\n\nSimilar to rails, the length of bridges can also increase due to expansion in summer. \nThe length of the 18 km long great belt bridge in Denmark increases by 4.7 m in summer. \nTherefore, provision is made in the construction of the bridges to accommodate this \nexpansion.\n\nWhich use of the expansion of liquids \nin daily life do you know?\n\nThe effect if  heat on water is \nsomewhat different from that for other \nliquids. This is called anomalous \nbehaviour of water. We are going to learn \nabout it in higher standard.\n\nExpansion of gases\nA gas does not even have a fixed \n\nvolume. Gas expands on heating but if the \ngas is kept in a closed box, its volume \ncannot increase but its pressure increases. \nThis is shown in figure 14.7\n\nObserve figure 14.7 and find out \nanswers to the questions.\n\n1. Using the formula density = mass / volume, \nexplain what will be the effect of heat on \nthe gas kept in a closed bottle.\n\n2. If the bottle is not closed but has a movable \npiston attached to its open end (see the \nfigure), what will be the effect of heating \nthe gas in the bottle?\nTherefore, the expansion of a gas is \nmeasured by keeping its pressure constant. \nThis volumetric expansion coeffcient is \ncalled the constant pressure expansion \ncoefficient and is given by the following \nformula.\n\nV\n2 \n= V\n\n1  \n(1 + b DT) .............................

Sound\n\nHow is sound produced ?\n\nIf the stem is kept steady and the prongs are \nstruck, the prongs are set into vibrations. It means \nthat they are set into periodic motion in forward and \nbackward direction. We will see, step by step, the \nresult of such a motion.\n\nIf during the vibration, the prongs of the tuning \nfork go away from each other, as shown in Figure \n15.2 (b), the air outside the prongs is compressed \nand the pressure there increases. Such a state of \nhigh pressure is created in region A in the figure. \nThe region in which air is at high pressure and high \ndensity is called compression. In the next step of \nvibration, the prongs of the fork come close to each \nother, as shown in Figure 15.2 (c). In this case, the \nair molecules near the prongs get more space to move \naway from each other. As a result, the air pressure \nin this region (Region A) decreases. Such region in \nwhich air is at low pressure and low density is called \nrarefaction.\n\nProng\n\nStem\n\n15.2 Production of sound by tuning \nfork\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n15.1 Tuning Fork\n\nProduction of Sound \nWe have learnt that sound can be generated from a vibrating \n\nobject.With an example of tuning fork, we will now learn about \nhow a sound is produced due to such vibrations. A photograph of \ntuning fork is shown in Figure 15.1.\n\nA tuning fork is made of two prongs and a stem. Keeping the \nstem steady, if the prongs are struck, they start vibrating.\n\nFigure 15.2 (a) shows a stationary tuning fork. To show the \nstate of air around the tuning fork, vertical lines are used. Here, \nthe vertical lines are equally spaced. It indicates that the average \ndistance between the air molecules is the same everywhere and the \naverage air pressure in three regions ‘A’, ‘B’ and ‘C’ is also the \nsame. \n\n However, the air molecules in this region, which were in compressed state earlier (Figure \n15.2 (b), region A) transfer their energy to the air molecules in the next region (region B). So, \nthe air in that region goes to compressed state (See Figure 15.2 (c), region B). Such a periodic \nmotion of the prongs creates compression and rarefaction in the air and these are propagated \naway from the prongs. These are nothing but the sound waves. When these waves reach our \near, the ear-drum vibrates. Accordingly, specific signals reach the brain and we get a sense \nof hearing a sound. \n\nIf sound waves are generated in air, what moves away \nfrom the source? Is it the air itself or the state of compression \nand rarefaction created in the air? \n\nCan you recall?\n\nUse your brain power\n\n\n\n105\n\nPropagation of sound and Medium: We have learnt \nin the sixth standard that sound travels through some \nmaterial medium like solid, liquid or gas and reaches \nus. But what if such medium does not exist between the \nsource of sound and our ear? \n\nSound generation and propagation needs medium \nlike air. A simple experiment can prove this. The \nexperimental arrangement is  shown in Figure 15.3. In \nthis experiment, a vaccum tight bell jar is placed on a \nsmooth horizontal surface. The bell jar is connected to a \nvacuum pump via a tube.  We can remove air inside the \nbell-jar, using the vacuum pump. As shown in the figure, \nthe bell jar contains an electric bell, which is connected \nto the power supply through the lid of the bell jar. \n\n15.4 Cycles of compression and rarefaction in a sound wave and change in air pressure\n\nAt the start of experiment, the vacuum \npump is off and the bell-jar contains air. If the \nkey to electric bell is now switched on, the bell \nstart ringing and the ringing can be heard from \noutside the bell jar. Now, if the vacuum pump \nis switched on, it starts removing the air from \nthe bell jar. As the quantity of air inside the bell \njar decreases, the level of ringing sound heard \noutside also decreases. If the pump is operated \nfor sufficiently long period, the quantity of air \nlike inside the bell jar will be low. At this point \nthe level of ringing sound will also be very \nlow.  This experiment demonstrates that sound \ngeneration and propagation needs a medium. \nIf the air inside the bell jar is totally removed, \nwill we be able to hear the sound of ringing bell? \nWhy?\nFrequency of Sound Waves : Using figure 15.2, we learnt about how the vibrations of tuning \nfork result in generation of compressions and rarefactions in air. More detail observation \nshows that, the actual variation in the air density and pressure are as shown in Figure 15.4. If \nany object vibrates in the air, such sound waves are produced in the air.  \n\n15.3 Medium is necessary for \npropogation of sound \n\nTo vaccum pump\n\nElectric bell\n\nBell jar\n\nTwo astronauts on the moon \ntalking to each other directly, will be \nunable to listen to each other, even if \nthey are very close to each other. The \nmoon does not have atmosphere. Since \nthere is no medium which is necessary \nfor generation and propagation of \nsound, between the astronauts, direct \nsound propagation between them is not \npossible. Therefore, the astronauts use \nsome technology like the one used in our \ncell-phones to communicate with each \nother. The waves used in cell-phone do \nnot need any medium for propagation.\n\nMotion of air molecules \ndue to sound\n\nPropagation of sound\n\nReduced pressure \n(rarefaction)\n\nAtmospheric pressure\n\nIncreased pressure \n(compression)\n\nOne oscillation consisting of \ncompression and rarefaction\n\nAlways remember\n\n\n\n106\n\nAs shown in the Figure 15.4, one compression and one rarefaction together forms one \ncycle of the wave. The number of cycles formed in the air in one second will be decided by the \nnumber of times the prongs of the tuning fork (or any other vibrating body) vibrates back and \nforth i.e. the number of vibrations of the tuning fork in one second. \n\nNumber of such cycles that are produced in the air (or other medium) per second is \ncalled as the frequency of the sound wave. The frequency is measured in Hertz. If one cycle \nis completed in one second, the frequency is said to be 1 Hz. For example, the tuning fork \nin Figure 15.1 shows its frequency to be 512 Hz. It means that the fork vibrates 512 times \nper second. These vibrations will set 512 cycles of compression and rarefaction in the air, \nper second. Thus, the sound generated by the fork will have a frequency of 512 Hz. The \nfrequency of a tuning fork is decided by the dimensions of the prongs  (length, thickness) and \nthe material used for making the fork.\n\nTake 6-7 glass cups. Arrange them in a line and fill them \nwith water with gradually increasing water level from one end \nto other. Take a pencil and strike the cups sequentially. The \nsound generated by each cup will be different. Why it is so? \n\nWhen a cup is struck, waves are set up in the air column \nabove the water level in the cup. The frequency of the generated \nwave depends on the height of the air column inside the glass \ncup. Since the water level in each glass is different, the height \nof the air column in each glass is also different. Therefore, the \nfrequency of sound generated by each glass cup will also be \ndifferent. So, the sound generated is different.  \n\nAn ‘app’ for measurement of sound frequency may be \n\nUse of ICT \nDownload videos \n\nof Jaltarang   from \nyoutube and send them \nto your friends by email.\n\nTry this\n\navailable on cell-phones. With the help of your teacher, use the app to measure the frequency of \nthe sound generated from each glass cup. Do you observe any relation between the frequency \nof generated sound and the height of the air column in the glass-cup? This is your simple ‘Jal-\ntarang’!  Can this experiment be performed with stainless steel pots of different sizes?\nSound and Music\n\nWhat are the frequencies of \nmusical notes ‘sa’, ‘re’, ‘ga’, \nma’,  ‘pa’, ‘dha’, ‘ni’ in the \n‘madhya saptak’? \n\nNote Frequency (Hz)\nsa 256\nre 280\nga 312\nma 346\npa 384\ndha 426\nni 480\n\nFrom the above activity, it is clear that if the  \nfrequency of sound wave is changed, different  sound is \nproduced.  Sound waves of different frequencies produce \ndifferent sound notes. In the field of music, various musical \ninstruments are used for creation of sound notes. This \nincludes instruments like sitar, violin, guitar which use \nstrings for production of sound and instruments like flute, \nshehnai which use air blown into pipes for the production \nof sound. \n\nIn string based instruments, the frequency of vibration \nof the string is changed by changing the tension on the \nstring and/or by changing the vibrating length of the string \nusing fingers. This results in generation of different notes. \n\nIn musical instruments like flute, the holes on the flute \nare opened or closed to change the length of vibrating air \ncolumn in the flute. The frequency of waves, therefore, \nchanges and it results in the production of different notes. \nIn flute, different notes can be generated by changing the \nway of air-blowing also.\n\nDo you know?\n\n\n\n107\n\n‘Apps’ for generation of different sound notes (sound note \ngenerator app) may be available on cell-phones. With the help of your \nteacher, using such an app, generate sound notes listed in the table.\n\nSound Produced by Human\nEither speak a little loudly or sing a song \n\nor produce humming sound like a bee and put \nyour fingers on your throat. Do you feel some \nvibrations?\n\nIn the humans, sound is produced in the  \nlarynx. While swallowing food, we can feel \nwith our finger a hard bump that seems to move. \nThis is nothing but larynx. As shown in Figure \n15.5, it is at the upper end of the windpipe. Two \nvocal cords, are stretched across the voice box or \nlarynx in such a way that it leaves a narrow slit \nbetween them for the passage of air.  \n\nWhen the lungs force air through the slit, the \nvocal cords vibrate, producing sound. Muscles \nattached to the vocal cords can make the cords \ntight or loose. When the vocal cords are tight and \nthin, the type or quality of voice is different.\n\nTake two rubber strips out of an unused \nbicycle tube. Place these two pieces one above \nthe other and stretch them tight. Now blow air \nthrough the gap between them. As the air blows \nthrough the gap between the rubber strips, a \nsound is produced.  Human larynx works in a \nsimilar way.\n\nVocal cords are 20 cm in length in \nmale, about 15 cm in female and even \nsmaller in children. Therefore the \nvoice of male, female and children are \ndifferent.\n\nIdentify the instruments and discuss sound production in them.\n\nEpiglottis\n(A flap that closes \nair-track during \nswallowing\n\nVocal Chords\n\nTrachea\nEsophagus\n\n15.5 : Larynx in human\n\nTry this\n\nTry this\n\nProduce a sound ‘bho…bho..’ just like a dog-barking and ‘meow..\nmeow..’ just like a mewing cat. Carefully notice the tension on the vocal \ncords, when you produce these sounds. Do you feel that the tension on \nthe vocal cords changes when you produce these two different sounds? \n\nObserve and discuss.\n\n\n\n108\n\nWe have seen that due to back and forth motion of the prongs of the tuning fork, sound \nwaves are produced. In the same way, here, due to back and forth motion of the loudspeaker \nscreen, sound waves are produced in air. \n\nYou can feel these vibrations of the loudspeaker screen, just by gently touching the screen \nof a loudspeaker, which is producing sound. Very loud sound can be produced by using a \nloudspeaker. Therefore, loudspeakers are used in public places. However, as we have learnt \nlast year, if sound level is around 100 decibels, the sound can be harmful to us. Therefore, \nalthough the loudspeaker can generate very loud sound, there must be limit on its loudness. \n\nSound generation by loudspeaker : \nYou know that sound can be produced using \nloudspeaker. The internal arrangement in the \nloudspeaker is shown in the form of cross-\nsectional view in Figure 15.6. It consists of a \npermanent magnet. A coil is wound around \nit and if a current flows through this coil, it \nalso generates magnetic field. This you have \nlearnt in earlier chapter in this book. \n\nYou must have seen that if two magnets \nare brought near each other, they move \ndepending on their positions. In the same \nway, here, depending on the magnetic field \ncreated due to the coil, the coil moves back \nand forth. The frequency and amplitude of \nthe movement of the coil depends on the \nvariation in the current flowing through the \ncoil. As the coil moves, the conical screen \nof the loudspeaker, which is attached to the \ncoil, also moves back and forth. \n\nAn ‘app’ may be available on cell-\nphones to measure the loudness of sound \nin decibel. With the help of your treacher, \nuse the app to measure the sound level of \na sound from a loudspeaker at some public \nplace. Measure the sound level at different \ndistances from the loudspeaker. Do you \nobserve some relation between the distance \nfrom the loudspeaker and the sound level?\n\nWe should take care that others \nare not disturbed when we study sound \nand its production. Sound pollution is a \nmajor cause affecting the environment \nand social health. Hence we should find \nways to avoid sound pollution.\n\n15.6 Internal construction of a loudspeaker\n\nPermanent magnet\n\nCoil\n\nFrom microphone\n\nScreen\n\nAlways remember\nTry this\n\n\n\n109\n\n1.

The sense of vision is the most important among \nour five senses. Because of this we can see the hills, rivers, trees, people and objects around \nus. Only with this we can see the beautiful views of nature like clouds, rainbow, flying birds, \nMoon, stars etc.\n\n16.1 Reflection of light\n\nSwitch off the light in your room at night for some time and then turn \nit on again.\n\n Could you see the objects in the room clearly when the light was switched off ? What did \nyou feel when it was turned on again? \n\nFrom the above activity you can notice that there is some connection between the sense \nof vision and light. When we switch off the light at night, the objects in the room cannot be \nseen and they can be seen as before when the light is switched on again. Thus, we can see \nobjects when the light coming from these objects enters our eyes. The light entering our eyes \nmay be emitted by the object or may be reflected by that object. What is meant by light \nreflected by an object? To understand this, let us learn about the reflection of light.\nReflection of light : When light rays fall on an object their direction changes and they turn \nback. This is called the reflection of light.\n\nMaterial : Torch light, mirror, a stand for hanging the mirror, black \npaper, comb, white paper, drawing board.\n\nActivity\n1. Fit a white paper tightly over a table or \n\ndrawing board.\n\n2. Leaving out some portion in the middle \nof the comb, cover the rest with black \npaper so that light can only pass through \nthe open central portaion. (figure 16.1)\n\n3. Hold the comb perpendicular to the \nwhite paper and throw torch light on its \ncentral portion. \n\n4. Adjust comb and torch so as to get light \nrays on the white paper. Now keep a \nmirror in the path of this ray of light as \nshown in the figure.\n\n5. What do you observe ?\n\n In this activity, light rays which fall on the mirror, get reflected and travel in a different \ndirection. The rays falling on any surface are called incident rays. The point at which an \nincident ray falls is called the point of incidence. the rays going away from the surface after \nreflection are called reflected rays. The direction of the reflected rays is decided by some rules \nwhich are called laws of reflection. Let us learn some definitions before learning about these \nlaws. \n\nTry this\n\nTry this\n\n\n\n111\n\n16.2 Reflection of light\n\nIncident ray\n\nA N B\n\nAngle of \nincidence\n\nP\nO\n\nQ\n\n16.3 Verification of the laws of \nreflection\n\nEquipment : Mirror, drawing board, pins, white paper, protractor, \nscale, pencil\n\nActivity :\n1.

These are \nas given below.\n1.The angle of reflection is equal to the angle   \n\nof incidence.\n2.The incident ray, the reflected ray and the  \n\nnormal lie in the same plane.\n3.The incident ray and the reflected ray are \n\non the opposite sides of the normal.\n\nNormal Reflected ray\n\nAngle of \nreflection\n\nPoint of \nincidence\n\n300\n\nSome terms related to reflection are as follows.\ni.   Ray AO is the incident ray  ii. Point O is the point of incidence\niii. Ray OB is the reflected ray iv. Line ON is the normal\nv.  The angle ÐAON, between incident ray and the normal is the angle of incidence (i) \nvi. The angle ÐBON between the reflected ray and the normal is the angle of reflection (r) \n\n\n\n112\n\n1. Laws of reflection are followed in both regular  and irregular reflection.\n\n2. The reflection of light in irregular reflection has not been obtained because the laws of \nreflection are not followed but they are obtained because the surface is rough. (irregular).\n\n3. In irregular reflection the angles of incidence at different points are different. But at \n\nany one point, the angles of incidence and reflection are equal, i.e i\n1\n=r\n\n1\n, i\n\n2\n=r\n\n2\n,...\n\n(a) Smooth surface\n\n(b) Rough surface\n\n16.4 Reflection of light from a smooth and \n\na rough surface\n\nWhat relation do you find between the angle of incidence and the angle of reflection? If \nyou have done the experiment carefully, you will find that the angle of incidence is equal to \nthe angle of reflection in all three cases. This verifies the laws of reflection.\n\nWhat will happen when a light ray is incident perpendicular to the \nmirror ?\n\nFigure 16.4 (a) and (b) show three \nparallel rays, shown in blue, incident on \nsmooth and rough surfaces.

Regular reflection of light : The reflection \nof light from a plane and smooth surface is \ncalled regular reflection of light. For regular \nreflection, the angles of incidence as well as \nof reflection are the same for all parallel rays \nfalling on the surface. Thus, the reflected \nrays are also parallel to one another. If the \nangles of incidence for incident rays are i\n\n1\n, i\n\n2\n, \n\ni\n3\n,.... and their angles of reflection are r\n\n1\n, r\n\n2\n, r\n\n3 \n\nrespectively then, i\n1\n= i\n\n2\n = i\n\n3 \n....= r\n\n1\n= r\n\n2\n= r\n\n3 \n...... \n\n(fig. 16.4 a). \n\n2. Irregular reflection of light : Reflection of light from a rough surface is called irregular \nreflection of light. In irregular reflection, the angles of incidence for parallel rays of incidence \n\nare not equal and therefore their angles of reflection are also not equal i\n1\n¹i\n\n2\n ¹i\n\n3\n....... and                \n\ni\n1 \n= r\n\n1 \n¹ r\n\n2 \n¹ r\n\n3\n.......\n\nThus, the reflected rays are not parallel to one another and spread over a large surface. \nThis is clear from figure 16.4 (b). \n\nTry this\n\nAlways remember\n\ni\n1\nr\n\n1 r2 r3i2 i3)) ) )) )\n\ni\n1\n\ni\n2\n\ni\n3\n\n)\n)\n\n) )\n))r\n\n1\n\nr\n2\n\nr\n3\n\n\n\n113\n\n16.5 Kaleidoscope\n\nCardboard tube\n\nSee through this\n\nMirrors\n\nCap for closing\n\n16.6 Periscope\n\nLight ray\n\nMirror\n\n450 \nangle\n\nReflection of reflected light\n\n1.

The image of the back of your head \nis formed in the mirror at the back. The image of this image is formed in the mirror in front of \nyou. Thus you can see how the hair at the back side of your head is cut.\n How do we see the image of the Moon in water? As moon is not self luminous, the Sun \nlight falling on the surface of the Moon is reflected. This reflected light is again reflected by \nwater to give us the image of the Moon. In this way light can be refleted serveral times.\n\nKaleidoscope  \n\n4. Insert 4-5 coloured glass pieces in the hollow of the mirrors. \n5.

This is used in \nsubmarianes to see objects above the surface \nof water. It is also used to observe and keep \na watch on the objects or persons on the \nground from an underground bunker. \nKaleidoscope and Periscope both use the \nproperties of reflection of light.\n\n1.

Man made Materials\n\nMake a list of 20 different manmade materials present in your \nhome, school and places around and discuss.\n\n We use various types of materials in our daily life. Those materials are made up of \nvarious materials like wood, glass, plastic, thread, soil, metals, rubber, etc. Out of those, \nwood, rock, minerals, water are natural. Human performed research on various natural \nmaterials in laboratory. With the help of it, various materials are manufactured in factories. \nSuch materials are called as manmade materials.  eg. Glass, plastic, artificial threads, \nthermocol, etc. \n\nClassify and make a chart of the materials used in various items \nin house. Make additions to that chart with reference to various \nmaterials.\n\nName of item Material used\nManmade Natural\n\nWooden chair Wood\nComb Plastic\n\nPlastic\nA manmade material showing the property of \n\nplasticity and made up of organic polymers is plastic. \nStructure of all the plastics is not same. Some are \nlinear while some are circular.\n Depending upon the effect of heat, plastic can be \nclassified into two types. The plastic that can be \nmolded as per our wish is called as thermoplastic. eg. \nPolythene, PVC are used for manufacturing the toys, \ncombs, plates, bowls etc. Another plastic is such that \nonce a specific shape is given with the help of mold, \nits shape cannot be changed on heating. It is called as \nthermosetting plastic. eg. Electric switches, coverings \nover the handles of cookers, etc.\n\n17.1 Plastic material\n\n17.2 Thermoplastic 17.3 Theromosetting plastic\n\nUse of Information Technology\nMake a collection of various \n\nvideos on process of plastic \nproduction. Using those videos, \nmake a presentation with the help \nof your teacher and send it to other \nthrough email and other \napplications.\n\nCan you tell?\n\nCollect information\n\n\n\n117\n\n1. Plastic is used in healthcare sector e.g. \nsyringes.\n\n2. Vessels used to cook food in microwave \noven are made up of plastic. \n\n3. Vehicles are coated with Teflon to protect \nfrom scratches. Teflon is a type of plastic.\n\n4. There are more than 2000 different types \nof plastics.\n\n5. Some types of plastic are used in \nassembling some parts of aeroplane.\n\n6. Polyacrylic is a type of plastic used for \nmanufacturing lenses & artificial teeth. \n\nProperties of Plastic: Plastic does not corrode. It does not decompose. It is not easily affected \nby humidity, heat, rain, etc. Items of any colour can be made from it. It can be molded into \nany shape due to the property of plasticity. It is bad conductor of heat and electricity. Being \nlight in weight, it is easy to carry. \n\nTypes and uses of the plastic\nThermoplastic\n\n1. Polyvinyl chloride \n(PVC)\n\nBottles, raincoat, pipes, handbags, shoes, electric cable insulation, \nfurniture, ropes, toys, etc.\n\n2. Polystyrene (PS) Thermo-insulating parts of electric appliances like refrigerators, \ngears of machines, toys, protective coverings like covers of CD and \nDVD, etc.\n\n3.

What \nhappens to those later on?\n2. How are the used up and thrown away \ncarry bags, water bottles, milk bags \nrecycled?\n\nSome materials are naturally \ndegraded, they are called as degradable \nmaterials while some materials do not; \ncalled as non-degradable material. \nFrom the given on next page chart, we \ncan understand that plastic is non-\ndegradable and hence it is an \nenvironment pollutant. Which measures \ncan we arrange to avoid this?\n\nDo you know?\n\nThink about it.\n\nThermosetting plastic\n\n1.

Discuss this in your classroom.\n\nWhich material is wrapped around the items of glass or similar \nmaterial during transport to prevent from breaking up?\n\nThermocol :  A new, easily breakable item brought at your home is usually packed in a box. \nSo as to prevent that item from breaking while handling the box, it is always packed in one \nmore wrapping. Usually, that wrapping is of thermocol. Now a day, the plates used in mass \nfeasts are also made up of thermocol. \n Thermocol is a form of a complex material called polystyrene. It transforms in to liquid \nstate on heating at more than 100 ºC temperature and returns to solid state on cooling. Due to \nthis, we can give any desired shape to it. Being a good shock-absorber, it is used in packing \nof delicate items.\n\nMake list about use of thermocol in your daily life.\n\n17.4 Thermocol combustion  and pollution\n\nAdverse effects of excessive use of thermocol \non environment and human:\n1. Being carcinogenic ingredients in styrene, the \nperson in contact with thermocol for long \nduration may have the possibility of blood cancer \nlike leukemia and lymphoma.\n2. Non-biodegradable : It takes long duration \nfor natural degradation of thermocol; hence \nmany people opt for destroying it by burning. \nHowever, it is still more hazardous method as it \nreleases poisonous gases in atmosphere.\n3. In mass gatherings, plates and cups used to \noffer the food, water, tea are made up of \nthermocol. It affects the health. If the food kept \nin thermocol is reheated, styrene may dissolve in \nthat food. Due to this, there is possibility of \nhealth problem.\n\nCan you tell?\n\nAlways remember\n\nMake a list and discuss \n\n We should opt for the items made up of \ndegradable material instead of plastic.          \nEg. jute bags, cloth bags, paper bags, etc.\n\n\n\n119\n\nInternet My Friend : See the video of bangle making on internet, note the information and \nread out in classroom. \n\n4. Effect on persons working in thermocol factory : Persons staying in contact with \nthermocol for long term may develop the problems of eyes, respiratory system, skin, digestive \nsystem, etc. Pregnant women may face the miscarriage. Liquid styrene may cause skin-burns.\n\nMake a list of glass items of daily use. Glass of which \ndifferent colours is used in those items?\n\nGlass : We use the glass material on large \nscale in our daily life. Glass was discovered \nby chance. Some Phoenician traders were \ncooking in desert. The cooking vessels were \nsupported on lime-stones. When the cooking \nvessel was kept off the lime-stone, they \nobserved that a transparent material has \nbeen formed. They thought that this \ntransparent material may had been formed \ndue to heating together of sand and lime-\nstone. This led to the development of \ntechnique of glass production. Glass is the \nnon-crystalline, hard but brittle solid material \nformed from mixture of silica and silicate. \nSilica i.e. SiO\n\n2\n to which we refer to as sand. \n\nDepending upon the proportion of silica and \nother components in the glass; there are \ndifferent types of glass as soda-lime glass, \nboro-silicate glass, silica glass, alkali-\nsilicate glass, etc.\n\nglass strip\n\n17.5 Glass manufacturing process\n\nraw material\n\nFurnace\n\nMolten glass\n\nroller\ncutter\n\nProduction of Glass : For glass production, mixture of sand, soda, lime, and small quantity \nof magnesium oxide is heated in furnace. Sand i.e. silicon dioxide melts at 1700 0C. So as to \nmelt the mixture at low temperature, pieces of discarded glass are added to it. Due to this, \nmixture melts at 850 ºC. Once all the ingredients of mixture are liquified, it is heated up to \n1500 ºC and immediately cooled. Due to sudden cooling, mixture becomes homogenous, \namorphous and transparent instead of crystalline. This is called Soda-lime glass.\n\nProperties of Glass :\n1. On heating, glass becomes soft and can be moulded into any shape.\n2. Density of glass depends upon its ingredients.\n3. Glass is slow conductor of heat. On quick heating of cool glass or on quick cooling of hot \n\nglass, it cracks / breaks.\n4. Being bad conductor of electricity, glass is used as insulator in electric appliances.\n5. Being transparent, most of light passes through the glass. However, if there are oxides of \n\neither chromium, vanadium or iron in the glass, large amount of light is absorbed in glass. \n\nMake a list and discuss \n\n\n\n120\n\nTypes of Glass and Uses:\n\n1. Silica glass : This is produced by using the \nsilica. Items made up of silica glass show \nminimum expansion on heating. It is not affected \nby acid and alkali. Due to this, silica glass is \nused to produce laboratory glass-wares.\n\n2. Borosilicate glass : Borosilicate glass is \nproduced by melting the mixture of sand, soda, \nboric acid and aluminium oxide. This glass does \nnot show any effect on medicines. Hence, the \nbottles made up of borosilicate glass are used in \npharmaceutical industry to store the medicines. \n\n3. Alkali silicate glass : Alkali silicate glass is \nproduced by heating the mixture of sand and \nsoda. As this glass is soluble in water, it called \nas 'water glass'.\n\n4. Lead glass : Lead glass is produced by melting \nthe mixture of sand, soda, limestone and lead \noxide. Being very clear / transparent, it is used in \nmanufacturing of light bulbs, tubes, etc.\n\n5. Optical glass : Optical glass is produced from \nthe mixture of sand, soda, limestone, barium \noxide and boron. This type of pure glass is useful \nin production of spectacles, lenses, microscopic \nlenses, etc.\n\n6. Coloured glass : Soda lime glass is colorless. \nSo as to impart a desired colour, oxide of specific \nmetal is mixed during manufacturing process. \neg. Ferrous oxide is mixed to get bluish green \nglass and copper oxide to get red glass.\n\n7. Processed glass : So as to improve the quality \nand utility, some processing is performed on \nglass and various types like reinforced glass, \nplain glass, fiber glass, fen glass, translucent \nglass, etc. are produced.\n \n\nEffect of glass on environment :\n\n1. While glass production, \n\nmixture needs to be heated up \n\nto 1500 ºC. During this, green \n\nhouse gases like sulphur \n\ndioxide, nitrogen dioxide, \n\ncarbon dioxide are released \n\nthrough burning of fuel.\n\n2. As the glass is non-degradable, \n\nif pieces of the waste glass \n\nmaterial flow into water body, \n\nit may affect that ecosystem. \n\nSimilarly, drainage may be \n\nblocked due to these pieces. \n\n1. To prevent the degradation due \nto sunlight, some materials are \nstored in which type of bottles?\n2.

Ecosystems\n\nThe organic substances (carbohydrates, proteins and lipids) from dead bodies of plants \n\nand animals are converted into inorganic substances  (hydrogen, oxygen, calcium, iron, sodium, \n\npotassium etc.) by microorganisms. Therefore, microbes are said to be 'Decomposers'.\n\n1. Which factors do you found in your surrounding? \n2. Are these factors directly or indirectly related to you ?\n\nClassify the following into living and non-living factors.\nSunlight, sunflower, elephant, lotus, algae, stone, grass, water, ant, \n\nsoil, cat, fern, air, lion.\n\nEcosystem : The world around us is made up of living and non living factors. Living are called \nbiotic factors while non living are called abiotic factors. There is a continuous interaction \nbetween these living and non living factors. Living organisms and their habitat, environment \nare corelated with each other.\nThe structure which is formed due to these reciprocal relationships is called an ecosystem. \nBiotic and abiotic factors and their interactions form an ecosystem.\n\nStructure of an ecosystem : Living organisms need different types of abiotic factors and they \nhave different capacities to adapt with those abiotic factors. Some microbes need oxygen, \nwhile others don’t.  Some plants need more sunlight, while others grow well in shade. \n\nAbiotic factors\n\nPhysical\n\nDecomposers\n\nOrganic subtances\n\nBiotic factors\n\nChemical\n\nConsumersProducers\n\nInorganic subtances\n\nPlants Animals Microbes\n\nTertiary\nConsumers\n\nHydrogen, Oxygen, \nNitrogen, Calcium, \nIron, Potassium, \nSodium\n\nPrimary \nConsumers\n\nAut\notro\n\nphi\nc\n\nProteins\nCarbohydrates\nLipids\n\nSecondary \nConsumers\n\nHeterotrophic\nAir, water, \nvapour, \nminerals, soil, \nSunlight\n\nEcosystem\n\nDo you know?\n\nCan you recall?\n\n18.1 Components of Ecosystem\n\n\n\n123\n\nEach and every abiotic factor (air, water, soil, sunlight, temperature, humidity) affects \nthe biotic factors in the ecosystem. The abiotic factors in an ecosystem decide which biotic \nfactors will survive in it and what will be their number. The proportion of abiotic factors in \nan ecosystem is always changing as biotic factors use or excrete abiotic factors. Every biotic \nfactor affects abiotic factors as well as other biotic factors around it. Every living organism in \nan ecosystem plays a particular role while living, moving in that ecosystem. \n\nThe position of any living organism in context to other living organisms and the role it \nis playing is called 'Niche'. Eg. A sunflower plant in a garden evolves oxygen in the air and \n\nprovides food and shelter for insects like ants, honey-bees etc.\n\n1. What is the role of microbes in above interaction ?\n2. How do producers obtain abiotic factors?\n3.

Some species are very few in number.Variety of ecosystems is \nfound on earth. Each place has a different ecosystem. eg.

In 1930, this question was asked to \n\na scientist Ray Claffam.  'ecosystem' was  \n\nhis answer. His colleague A.G. Tansle used \n\nthis word in 1935. 'Biotic community' is \n\nanother name for 'ecosystem.'\n\nMany types of ecosystems are found in biosphere. Their specific functions continue \naccording to their environment. Though these ecosystems look independent and different they \nare linked to each other directly or indirectly. Therefore we can not separate these small \necosystems from each other, but can classify them according to their functions. \n\nIn some regions on earth, a large area \nhas same climate and abiotic factors. The \nliving organisms in those area are also \nsimilar. So a specific ecosystem developes \nin a vast area. Such large ecosystems are \ncalled 'Biomes'. These biomes contain \nmany small ecosystems. Earth itself is \na vast ecosytem.Two types of biomes \nare found on the earth. i. Land biomes ii. \nAquatic biomes\n\nLand biomes : The biomes which exist only on land are called land biomes.  Due to unequal \ndistribution of abiotic factors different types of ecosystems exist. Eg. Grasslands, evergreen \nforests, deserts, iceland ecosystem, ecosystems in Taiga, tropical rainforests etc.\n\na. Grassland Ecosystem : Grasslands develop where rainfall is not enough to grow big trees. \nVast growth of grass is found in these ecosystems. Longer summer and limited rain develop \ndwarf plants in these areas. Animals like goat, sheep, giraffe, zebra, elephant, deer, chital, \ntiger, lion, etc. are found in this ecosystem. Similarly various birds, insects, microbes are also \npresent.\n\n18.3 Grassland\n\n1. What are the possible threats to  \ngrasslands?\n\n2.

Therefore study of \naquatic biomes becomes very important. \nAccording to area, aquatic biomes are \nwidespread. Types of aquatic ecosystems \nare - Fresh water ecosytem, marine \necosystem, creek ecosystem.\n\nA. Fresh water ecosystem : Ponds, lakes and rivers are included in aquatic ecosystems. The \ntransition of energy in these ecosystems is through water currents and river. Decomposers are \nat the bottom of water reservoirs. They decompose dead bodies of plants and animals convert \ninto abiotic factors.

Marine Ecosystems : Marine plants grow in these ecosystems. Shallow water contains \nsmall fishes, prawns feeding on algae. The central part of sea has less number of aquatic living \norganisms. Large fishes are secondary consumers. Ocean has a large amount of nutrients. The \nbottom of oceans has more number of decomposers. Dead bodies of plants and animals, waste \nmaterials are decomposed by bacteria.\n\nDiscuss \n\nDo you know?\n\n\n\n127\n\nToday Divija visited a hill. Honey-\nbees were hovering on flowers.

Collect the information about mishaps in aquatic ecosystems  \noccurred due to human interference. \n\n2. How is Creek different from Sea?\n\n18.6 Diminition of ecosystem\n\nDiminishment of ecosystem due to human \n\ninterference : Many human activities have \nside effects on functions of ecosystems and \ncause their diminishment. Eg. mining and \nexcessive cutting of trees changes the use \nof land, so interactions between biotic and \nabiotic factors are also affected.\n\nDifferent human activities have \ndifferent effects on ecosystems. They can be \ntranformation of an ecosystem from one to \n\nanother or extinction of a species.\n\nHuman activities responsible for diminishment of \necosystems\n\nIncreasing use of resources due to increased population :\nHumans are the consumers in an ecosystem. Ecosytems can \nprovide basic needs in normal conditions, but due to increased \npopulation, man kept on snatching natural resources on large \nscale. Changing life style demands ‘more’ than 'necessary'. \nThat has increased stress on the ecosystems and has generated \nvast amount of wastes.\nUrbanization : Due to continuous process of urbanization. More and more agricultural lands, \nmarshlands, wetlands, forests and grasslands are being destroyed for buildings and other \nbasic facilities around. As a result of this human interference, ecosystems either change or get \n\ncompletely destroyed.\n\nIndustrialization and traffic : Raw materials required for industrialization are obtained by \ndestroying forests. This result in destruction of forests.\n\nTo provide the amenities for increased traffic, many times roads and railways are built \n\nthrough forests and wetlands.\n\nTourism : People visit scenic places mainly for nature watch, entertainment and visit to \nsacred places. A lot of ameneties are created for these tourists. This causes destruction of \nlocal ecosytems due to increased stress.\n\nVisit any tourist centre nearby. Collect information about effect \nof tourism on the ecosystem there. \n\nLarge Dams : Dams cover vast lands. So the forests or grassland in that area get converted into \naquatic ecosystems. Dams also lessen the water current in lower area. Therfore the previous \necosystems in that running water get destroyed.\n\nThink about it.\n\nCollect information\n\n\n\n128\n\n1.

What is a galaxy?\n\n19. Life Cycle of Stars\n\n2. What are the different constituents of our \nsolar system?\n3. What are the major differences between a \nstar and a planet?\n\n19.1 The figure shows a spiral \ngalaxy. Our solar system is \nsituated in a similar galaxy.\n\nOur galaxy has about \n1011 stars. Its shape is like a \ndisc with a bulge in the centre \nand its diameter is about 1018 \nkm. The solar system is \nsituated at a distance of 2 ´ \n1017 km from its centre. The \ngalaxy is rotating around an \naxis passing through its centre \nand perpendicular to the disc. \nIts period of rotation is about \n2 ´ 108 yrs.\n\n We have learnt about the structure of the universe in earlier standards. Our solar system \nis situated in a galaxy. A galaxy is a collection  of billions of stars, their planetary systems \nand interstellar clouds which are present in the empty spaces between stars. The universe is \nmade up of innumerable such galaxies. Galaxies differ in structure and shape. We can divide \nthem into three types : spiral, elliptical and irregular galaxies. Our galaxy is a spiral galaxy \nand is called the Milky Way and Mandakini. A spiral galaxy is show in figure 19.1 \n\n4. What is a satellite?\n5. Which is the star nearest to us?\n\n How did we obtain all this information about the \nuniverse? \nIf we look at the sky at night we see only planets and stars, \nthen how did we get information about the other components \nof the universe? The answer to the question is telescopes. \nSeveral telescopes are placed on the surface of the earth, \nwhile some others are kept aboard manmade satellites \nwhich are orbiting the earth in fixed orbits. As these \ntelescopes are situated above the earth’s atmosphere they \ncan observe astronomical objects more effectively. \nAstronomers study the observations made by all these \ntelescopes to obtain detailed information about the universe. \nWe are going to learn about all this in higher standards. \nHere, let us learn about the properties of stars and their life \ncycle.\nProperties of stars : At night, we can see about 4000 stars \nwith our naked eyes. Sun is an ordinary star among them. \nThe reason to call Sun an ordinary star is that even though \nit appears to be larger than all others stars in the sky because \nof its being nearest to us, there are bilions of stars which \nhave higher or lower mass size and temperature than those \nof the Sun. Stars are gigantic spheres of hot gas. Some \nproperties of the Sun are given in the table below. Hydrogen \nmakes up for 72% of the mass of the Sun while helium is \n26%. The rest 2% is made up of elements heavier than \nhelium. \n\nDo you know?\n\nCan you recall?\n\nMass 2 x 1030 kg\n\nRadius 695700 km\n\nSurface temperature 5800 K\n\nTemperature at the centre 1.5 x 107 K\n\nAge 4.5 x 109 yr\n\nProperties of \nthe Sun :\n\n\n\n130\n\n19.2 A comparison of sizes of different stars\n\n The masses of other stars are measured \nwith respect to the mass of the Sun. This \nmeans that the mass of the Sun, written as \nM\n\nSun\n is used as the unit of mass.\n\n Light takes about 1 s to reach us from the moon while it takes 8 minutes to reach us from the \nSun. It takes 4.2 years to reach us from the star alpha Centauri which is the star closest to the Sun.\n\n The mass of the Sun is about 3.3 lakh \ntimes that of the earth and its radius is 100 \ntimes that of the earth. Other stars have \nmasses between   \n\n 1\n\n10\n (\n\n M\nSun\n\n  10\n)  that of the Sun \n\nand 100 times that of the Sun (100 M\nSun\n\n) and \ntheir radii can between   \n\n 1\n10  to 1000 times the \n\nradius of the Sun. (Fig. 19.2)\n The age of the Sun and other stars, which \nis the time elapsed after their formation, can \nbe between a few million years to a few billion \nyears. If the properties of the Sun had changed \nin its life time, it would have caused changes \nin the properties of the earth and in the life on \nthe earth. Detailed studies of the properties of \nthe earth have led scientists to conclude that \nthe properties of the Sun have remained \nunchanged over its lifetime i.e. the past 4.5 \nbillion years. According to the studies made \nby astromomers, these properties will slowly \nchange in further after 4.5 billion years.\n\nBirth of stars\n Huge clouds of gas and dust are present in the empty spaces between stars in a galaxy. \nThese are called interstellar clouds. Figure 19.3 shows a picture of such clouds taken by the \nHubble space telescope. Scientists use the unit of light year for measuring large distances. A \nlight year is the distance travelled by light in one year. As the speed of light is 3,00,000 \nkm/s, the light year is equal to 9.5 x 1012 km. The sizes of interstellar clouds are about a few \nlight years, i.e. light takes a few years to go from one end of a cloud to the other. From this \nyou can imagine the huge size of the cloud.\n\n19.3 A picture of interstellar clouds \n\ntaken by the Hubble space telecope\n\n Due to some disturbance, these clouds start \ncontracting. Because of the contraction, their \ndensity starts increasing and their temperature also \nstarts to increase and a dense sphere of hot gas is \nformed from the cloud. Once the temperature and \ndensity at the centre of the sphere increase \nsufficiently, nuclear energy (energy generated \nthrough fusion of atomic nuclei) generation starts \nthere. Because of this energy generation, the gas \nsphere becomes self luminous and a star is formed \nor we can say that a star is born. In  the Sun, this \nenergy is generated by the fusion of hydrogen nuclei \nto form helium nuclei. This means that the hydrogen \nat the centre of the star acts as a fuel and energy is \ngenerated by the burning of this fuel.\n\nDo you know?\n\nDo you know?\n\nWhite\nDwarf\n\nSuper Giant\n\nStarSun\n\nRed Giant Star\n\n\n\n131\n\n19.4 : A large cluster of stars. Most of \nthese stars have formed from a single \ninterstellar cloud.\n\n When a gas sphere contracts, its temperature increaes. This happens because of \ntransformation of its gravitational potential energy into heat energy.\n\n1.  If there was no gas pressure in the Sun, it will collapse to a point in 1-2 hours. \n2. Gas pressure depends on the density and temperature of the gas. Higher the \n\ntemperature and density, higher is the pressure.\n\n More than one star can be produced by the contraction of a huge interstellar cloud. Figure \n19.4 shows a cluster of thousands of stars. Most of these stars have formed from a single \ngigantic interstellar cloud.\n\n What is meant by balanced and unbalanced \nforces? \nStability of stars :  If we burn an incense stick \nin one corner of a room, the fragrance spreads \nall over the room instantaneously. Similarly, \nwhen we remove the lid of a vessel containing \nboiling water, the steam spreads in the \nsurrounding region. This means that hot gas \nspreads everywhere. Then, why doesn’t the hot \ngas in the stars disperse in space? And why have \nthe properties of the Sun remained unchanged \nover the last 4.5 billion years? \n\nThe answer to these questions is the gravitational force. The gravitational force between \nthe gas particles of the star keeps these particles together. If the gravitational force which is \nconstantly trying to bring the gas particles close together and the pressure of the hot gas which \nis constantly trying do disperse the gas are balanced, then the star remains stable. The \ngravitatinal force is acting inwards, towards the centre of the star while the gas pressure is \nacting outwards, i.e. away from the centre of the star (see figure 19.5).\n\n You must have played tug of war. In this, two ends of a \nrope are pulled on two sides by two groups. When the forces \napplied by both sides are equal, they balance each other and \nthe centre of the rope remains static. When the force on one \nside of the rope is larger than that on the other side, the \ncentre of the rope moves towards that side. Something \nsimilar happens in the case of a star. When the gravitational \nforce and gas pressure are balanced, the star is stable. But \nwhen one of them is more than the other, the star either \ncontracts or expands.\n\nDo you know?\n\nDo you know?\n\nCan you recall?\n\nGravitation\n\nPressure of \nhot gas Think about it.\n\n\n\n132\n\nEvolution of stars\n Evolution of a star means change in its \nproperties with time resulting in its passing \nthrough different stages. We have seen that \nthe properties of the Sun have not changed in \nthe past 4.5 billion years. Stars evolve very \nslowly for most of their life time. As stars are \ncontinuously emitting energy, their energy is \nconstantly decreasing.\n For their stability to remain intact i.e. \nfor maintaining a balance between the gas \npressrue and the gravitational force, it is \nnecessary that the temperature remains \nconstant. For the temperature to remain \nconstant, energy must be generated inside \nthe star. This generation of energy occurs \nbecause of burning of fuel at the centre of the \nstar. The reason for the evolution of stars is \nthe burning of and therefore, the decrease in \nthe amount of fuel in their centre. When the \nfuel in the centre finishes, the energy \ngeneration stops. As a result, the temperature \nof the star starts decreasing. Due to the \ndecrease in temperature, the gas pressure \ndecreses and the balance between gas \npressure and gravitatinal forece cannot be \nmaintained. As the gravtational force is now \nhigher than the gas pressure, the star starts \ncontracting. This causes another fuel to start \nburning e.g. when hydrogen at the centre is \nfinished, helium starts undergoing fusion \nand energy generation starts again. How \nmany fuels will be used depends on the mass \nof the star. \n\nHigher the mass of the star higher is the \nnumber of fuels used. During this a lot of \nchanges occur in the star. As a number of \nprocesses occur inside the star, it sometimes \ncontracts and expands at other times and the \nstar goes through different stages. When all \npossible fuels are exhausted, the energy \ngeneration finally stops and the temperature \nof the star starts decreasing. The balance \nbetween gravitational force and gas pressure \ncannot be maintained. Let us now see how \nthe evolution of the stars ends and what the \nend stages of stars are.\nEnd stages of stars : The higher the mass of \nthe star faster is its rate of evolution. The \ndifferent stages during the evolution of the \nstar which is the path of evolution of the star, \nalso depends on its mass. How does the \nevolution finally stop?\n We have seen that when the energy \ngeneration stops, the temperature decreases \ncausing the gas pressure to decrease. The \nstar contracts and its density increases. \nWhen the density becomes very high, some \nnew types of pressures are generated which \ndo not depend on the temperature of the gas. \nIn such case, the gas pressure remains \nconstant even after the energy generation \nstops completely and the temperature of the \ngas goes on decreasing. The stability of the \nstar can remain intact for ever and this can \nbe considered as the end stage of a star.\n\n There are three ways of evolution \nof stars depending on their initial mass. \nThus, we can divide stars in three \ngroups. The path of evolution and end \nstage for all stars in the same group is \nthe same. Lets us learn more about it. \n\n1. End stages of stars having initial mass less than 8 time the mass of the Sun (M\nstar\n\n <  8 \nM\n\nSun\n) : Stars in this group undergo huge expansion and their radius increases by a factor of \n\n100 to 200. In this stage they are called red giant stars. This name is given because of the \nlarge size and because of the fact that the stars look reddish due to their lower temperature. \nThe size of a red giant star in comparison to other types of stars is shown in figure 19.2. At \n\n19.6 Evalution of stars based on their mass and their end stages\n\nLife cycle of stars\n\nLow \nmass star Red \n\ngiant\n\nWhite dwarf\n\nInterstellar \ncloud\n\nSuper giant\n\nNeutron \nstar\n\nBlack \nhole\n\nExplosion\n\nHigh mass \nstar\n\nSupernova \nexplosion\n\n\n\n133\n\n19.7 : The outer gaseous envelop \nwhich is thrown out during the \nformation of a white dwarf which \nis at the centre.\n\nWhen the sun will become a red giant, its diameter will increase so much that it will \nswallow Mercury and Venus. It is possible that the earth will also be absorbed by the Sun. It \nwill take 4-5 billion years for the Sun to reach this state.\n\n1. As the size of the white dwarfs is similar to that of the earth, their density is very large. \nOne spoonful material of the white dwarf will weight a few tons. As neutron stars are much \nsmaller than the white dwarfs, their density is even higher and one spoonful material of \nthese stars will weigh as much as the weight of all living beings on the earth.\n\n2. A star in our galaxy exploded about 7500 years back. As the star is about 6500 light years \naway from us, the light emitted in the explosion took 6500 years to reach us. It was first seen \non the earth by the Chinese in the year 1054. It was so bright that it could be seen during the \nday also for 2 years. After 1000 years of the explosion, the gases emitted during the explo-\nsion are seen to be expanding with velocities higher than 1000 km/s.\n\nthe end of its evolution, these stars explode and their \nouter gas envelope is thrown out. The inner part \ncontracts and its size becomes similar to the size of the \nearth. As the mass of the star is much higher than that \nof the earth and the size is similar to that of the earth, \nthe density in the star becomes very high. In this state, \nthe pressure due to the electrons in the star becomes \nindependent of temperature and is able to balance the \ngravitatinal force for ever. In this state, the star looks \nwhite and due to its small size it is called a white dwarf. \nAfter this its temperature keeps decreasing but its size \nand mass remain unchanged for ever and so white \ndwarf is the end stage of stars in this mass range.\n\n2. End stages of stars having mass between 8 and 25 time the mass of the Sun (8 M\nSun\n\n <  \nM\n\nStar \n< 25 M\n\nSun\n) : These stars also go through the red giant stage and later through the \n\nsupergiant stage during which their size may increase 1000 times. The huge explosion, called \nthe supernova explosion, which occurs at last is very powerful and so much energy is given \noff that we can see the star during the day also.\n\n The central portion which is left behind after \nthe explosion, contracts and its size becomes \nas small as about 10 km. In this state, the \nstars are completely made up of neutrons \nand are called neutron stars. The pressure of \nthese neutrons is independent of temperature \nand is capable of balancing the gravitatinal \nforce for ever. Neutron star is the end stage \nof these stars.\n\nDo you know?\n\nDo you know?\n\n19.8 A recent picture of the supernova explosion which was first seen in 1054 A.D. \n\n\n\n134\n\n3.

As their \nsize becomes smaller, their density and their \ngravitational force increase tremendously. \nAll nearby objects get attracted towards \nthese stars and nothing can come out of \nthem, not even light.
