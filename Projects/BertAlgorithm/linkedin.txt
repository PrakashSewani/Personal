GROUP AND ITS ACTIVITIES\nCapgemini group fundamentals\n\n6 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n1.\n\n1.1  Capgemini group fundamentals\n\n1.1.1  Group history\n\nFrom 1967 to today, the milestones of a world leader\n\nFounded in 1967 by Mr. Serge Kampf in Grenoble, the Group has \ndeveloped around principles which continue to guide us today: \nan entrepreneurial spirit, followed by a passion for clients, an \nobsession with getting the best from people, extremely high \nperformance expectations, and a commitment to being ethically \nirreproachable at all times.\n\nNow, led by Aiman Ezzat and chaired by Paul hermelin, Capgemini \nhas 270,000\xa0employees, including more than 125,000 in India, and it \noperates in nearly 50\xa0countries. As in 1967, Capgemini still has the \nsame passion: helping businesses to be more eficient, innovative, \nand agile through technology.\n\n1967-1974 | The rise of an entrepreneurial spirit\n\n1967 Mr. Serge Kampf founds Sogeti, an IT services company, in Grenoble. \n\n1970 The visionary Sogeti is the first IT services company in Europe to offer organizational Consulting Services. \n\n1974 The first acquisitions with the purchase of two competitors: CAP (France) and Gemini Computer Systems (USA). \n\n1975-1989 | Expansion\n\n1975 Sogeti becomes Cap Gemini Sogeti, the European leader in IT services, with 2,000\xa0employees. \n\n1976 SESA, the French IT services company specializing in system integration (which will join the Group in 1987), develops \nTRANSPAC, the first public European data transmission network.\n\n1978 Cap Gemini Sogeti launches on the US market and creates Cap Gemini\xa0Inc. in Washington.\n\n1985 Cap Gemini Sogeti is listed on the Paris Stock Market: the share price surges +25% in just 5\xa0days.\n\n1987 Acquisition of SESA, the French IT services company. Cap Gemini Sogeti had already held a 42% stake in the Company  \nsince 1982.\n\n1990-1997 | Pursuing leadership\n\n1990 \n1992\n\nCap Gemini Sogeti acquires the UK company hoskyns, the European leader in managed services. Just two years later,  \nCap Gemini Sogeti becomes the European leader in its sector following successive acquisitions of the Dutch company Volmac \n– recognized at the time as the most profitable IT services company in Europe – and Programmator, one of the largest IT \nservices companies in Sweden.\n\n1996 Name change to Cap Gemini – removing the Company’s original name (Sogeti). \n\n1998-2001 | Emergence of a global champion\n\n1998 Multinational contract signed with General Motors to develop new client/server systems in 42\xa0countries.\n\n2000 Cap Gemini acquires the consulting arm of Ernst & Young, with integration proving more dificult than expected.

Cap Gemini now has over 50,000\xa0employees.\n\n2002-2009 | New horizons\n\n2002 Mr. Paul hermelin, who had worked alongside Mr. Serge Kampf since 1993, becomes Group CEO. The Sogeti name returns \nwith the creation of a subsidiary specializing in local IT services.\n\n2003 The Group signs one of the largest outsourcing contracts in its history with the UK’s Inland Revenue.\n\n2007 The Group closes another key acquisition with Kanbay International.

With the acquisition, Capgemini becomes the leader in the \nrapidly growing Intelligent Industry market, launching three new sets of offers.\n\nIn response to the pandemic, Capgemini takes action to protect the health and Safety of its employees, while staying \ncommitted to its partners and customers. The Group mobilized its teams around the world to launch community initiatives, \nsupervised by the newly created Social Response Unit.\n\nIn July\xa02020, we announced our commitment to making all our operations carbon neutral by 2025 at the latest and achieving \n“zero net emissions” by 2030. This commitment is founded on a series of new carbon footprint reduction objectives \napproved by the Science Based Targets initiative as being consistent with the level of reduction needed to limit global \nwarming to 1.5°C. Capgemini is now a signatory of the RE100 and determined to source\xa0100% renewable energy by 2025.\n\n1.1.2  Seven values, the foundation of our culture at the heart of what we do\n\nSince the creation of the Group in 1967 by Serge Kampf, culture \nand business practices have been inspired and guided by our seven \ncore values. These are the guiding principles that we collectively \nand individually stand for and are at the heart of our approach as \nan ethical and responsible business.\n\nHonesty signifies loyalty, integrity, uprightness, a complete refusal \nto use any underhanded method to help win business or gain any \nkind of advantage. Neither growth nor profit nor independence have \nany real worth unless they are won through complete honesty and \nprobity. And everyone in the Group knows that any lack of openness \nand integrity in our business dealings will be penalized at once.\n\nBoldness, which implies a flair for entrepreneurship and a desire \nto take considered risks and show commitment (naturally linked \nto a firm determination to uphold one’s commitments). This is \nthe very soul of competitiveness: firmness in making decisions \nor in forcing their implementation, an acceptance periodically to \nchallenge one’s orientations and the status quo.\n\nTrust, meaning the willingness to empower both individuals and \nteams; to have decisions made as close as possible to the point \nwhere they will be put into practice. Trust also means giving priority, \nwithin the Company, to real openness toward other people and \nthe widest possible sharing of ideas and information.\n\nFun means feeling good about being part of the Company or \none’s team, feeling proud of what one does, feeling a sense of \naccomplishment in the search for better quality and greater \neficiency, feeling part of a challenging project.\n\nFreedom, which means independence in thought, judgment and \ndeeds, and entrepreneurial spirit, creativity. It also means tolerance, \nrespect for others, for different cultures and customs: an essential \nquality in an international Group.\n\nModesty, that is simplicity, the very opposite of affectation, \npretension, pomposity, arrogance and boastfulness. Simplicity is \nabout being discreet, showing natural modesty, common sense, \nbeing attentive to others and taking the trouble to be understood \nby them. It is about being frank in work relationships, having a \nrelaxed attitude, having a sense of humor.\n\nTeam spirit, meaning solidarity, friendship, fidelity, generosity, \nfairness in sharing the benefits of collective work; accepting \nresponsibilities and an instinctive willingness to support common \nefforts when the storm is raging.\n\nDriven by its Values, the Group continues to forge trusted, long-\nterm business relationships to lead the way into an ethical future.\n\n\n\nPRESENTATION OF ThE GROUP AND ITS ACTIVITIES\nCapgemini group fundamentals\n\n8 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n1.\n\n1.1.3  The Group business lines\n\n —  Strategy & Transformation\n\nWith Capgemini Invent, Capgemini builds on its expertise in the \nstrategy, technology, data science, and creative design fields \nto support clients within the digital economy.

In \nthis cyclical market, Capgemini maintains strong market \npositions; \n\n—  the application, infrastructure & network implementation \nmarket is worth $246\xa0 billion. Capgemini is a market leader \nwith a particular focus on application implementation; \n\n— t he managed services and cloud infrastructure services is \na $417\xa0 billion global market. The system integration and \noutsourcing markets remain predictable, and activities are \nbased on long term relationships with clients; \n\n—  Business Process Outsourcing has reached $162\xa0billion and \ncontinues to grow; \n\n— C apgemini is the market leader in the Engineering, Research \n& Development market which is worth $176\xa0billion.\n\n1.2.2 Market trends  \n\nCapgemini sees a growing addressable market (4) beyond the \n“traditional” Chief Information Oficer (CIO) perimeter driven by \nthe growth of digitalization across the enterprise, with spending \non technology becoming increasingly collaborative by executives.\n\n—  The Chief Marketing Oficer (CMO) whose spend on \ntechnology continues to increase notably due to the growth \nof digital marketing, which has become a key enabler for the \nCMO to deliver the “end-to-end customer experience” to \ntheir customers. The IT spend on digital marketing is largely \nincremental to the traditional IT budget. CMO marketing \nbudgets are slightly increased at 11% of revenues (versus \n\n10.5% in 2019) and spend on marketing technology remains \nstrong (26% of budget). CMOs prioritized customer retention \nand growth. (5)\n\n—  The Chief Operating Oficer (COO), product owners and/or \nManufacturing Executives control significant spend across \nproduct development, operations and process. There is a \ngrowing focus on enabling more intelligent delivery models, \nthrough increased eficiency, intelligent production and \nongoing product customization (to meet changing consumer \ndemands). here again the IT spend is largely incremental to \nthe traditional IT budget.\n\nIntelligent Industry\n\nIntelligent Industry goes beyond Industry 4.0, applying digital \ntechnologies to connect the entire end-to-end industrial value \n\nchain from design, research & development, and engineering, \nthrough to production, operations, supply chain and support – \nrealizing the inherent value of data within manufacturing and the \nwider industrial world.\n\n\n\nPRESENTATION OF ThE GROUP AND ITS ACTIVITIES\nUnique assets in a constantly changing market\n\nCAPGEMINI 13\n\n1.\n\nWhat happens then?\n\n—  Products become smart: as data is embedded in the design \nof products, then how they are made, tested, serviced, and \nsupported.\n\n—  Factories become smart: thanks to automation, Internet \nof Things (IoT), predictive maintenance, robotics, Virtual \nReality, digital twins, remote monitoring, and simulation of \nproduction methods.\n\n—  Resource use becomes smart: allowing for optimization of \nthe supply chain, delivery, stock, and increased customer \nsatisfaction.\n\nManufacturing will move from being uni-directional (humans \ndirecting machines to produce goods, which are then sold to \nconsumers) to being multi-directional, where consumers request \ngoods straight from companies, manufacturing planning systems \ndirect production (thanks to automation and Industrial IoT), and \norganize raw materials (through digital supply chains) and relevant \nlogistics (via self-driving/robot warehousing) accordingly.\n\nAt the heart of this is the need for the enterprise to become data \ndriven in all that it does.\n\nCapgemini is well positioned to do this for clients, leveraging the \npower of data to deliver innovation, better customer experiences \nand new sources of value.\n\nAcross the market, there is an increase in new buying centers \nas digital transformation moves from the front-end customer \nexperience to pervade wider enterprise operations. An indicator \nof this is the increased collegiality in buying behavior across \nthe c-suite with the CIO operating in partnership with the CxO \nstakeholders. As the market continues to evolve and clients look \nto harness the benefits of new solutions with an emergence of \nnew enterprise buyers, it is important to stay close to our clients’ \ndecision-makers, which now include marketing and operational \nexecutives, to meet their new needs. This reflects a buoyant and \nnatural market position for Capgemini.\n\nThis disruption is underpinned by:\n\n— d igital transformation is now inherent across the enterprise \nand considered the new normal, consistently driving a \nnew digital landscape for the enterprise based on the key \nfoundations of CORE IT; \n\n—  the infusion of increasingly ubiquitous and transversal digital \nenablers (AI, deep learning, analytics, automation, DevOps, \npublic, hybrid or sovereign cloud) while protecting from \ncyber-attacks; \n\n—  the speed of adoption of new technologies is changing \nbusiness behavior as the new products and services become \na major driver for companies’ profitability, thus bringing \nCMO/CXOs to join the CIO (IT) in exploring and applying new \ntechnologies across the value chain. Therefore, CMO/CXOs \nhave an increasing influence on technology spend.\n\n1.2.3  A demanding competitive environment\n\nOur global marketplace continues to evolve and we compete with \na variety of organizations that offer solutions comparable to ours:\n\n—  global players (e.g. Accenture, IBM, TCS, Infosys); \n—  consulting and advisory players (e.g. Deloitte, KPMG, PwC or \n\nEY); \n—  regional and boutique players (e.g. EPAM, Sopra Steria or \n\nTieto); \n—  specialist players in the ER&D domains (e.g. Alten, Akka or \n\nBertrandt).\n\nWe also observe the continued evolution of Digital Agencies – e.g. \nPublicis Sapient or divisions of global players such as Accenture \nInteractive or Deloitte Digital.\n\nFurther, we see the continued growth of Engineering Research & \nDevelopment spend within customers with the emergence of an \naddressable Digital Engineering market that increasingly looks to \nconsume, integrate, deploy and secure new technologies across \nartificial intelligence, cloud, Internet of Things, cybersecurity,\xa0etc.\n\nThe main competitive factors that we believe exist in the \nmarketplace are:\n\n—  ability to deliver – in both individuals and products; \n—  expertise – in business, technology as well as industry \n\nknowledge; \n—  innovation – through partner ecosystems, services and \n\nportfolio offers; \n—  reputation and integrity – in both testimonials and client \n\nreferences; \n—  value – in adding and improving business performance; \n—  pricing – in contractual terms and pricing; \n—  service and scope – in bringing the right people and products \n\nto clients; \n—  delivery – quality results on a timely basis; \n—  global reach and scale – in providing the right level of \n\npresence in key markets.\n\n1.2.4  Ecosystem of partners\n\nCapgemini has always forged strategic partnerships with high \nprofile technology companies and with start-ups with specialist \nskills. The Group has always maintained an independent posture \nwith partners so that we are free to select those that offer the \nbest response to the expectations and challenges of Capgemini’s \nclients on a case-by-case basis.\n\nWe have continued to accelerate joint initiatives with selected \npartners, to help clients manage and accelerate their digital \ntransformation journey:\n\n—  Cloud with Amazon Web Services (AWS): we developed \na range of market solutions that focuses on a cloud-first \nstrategy that enables growth, innovation, cost-eficiency \nand business model disruption. We continued to expand our \nstrategic initiative to further meet the needs of customers \nby focusing on mass application migrations, cloud native \ndevelopment, cloud application modernization, artificial \nintelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), managed vertical \nsolutions and managed services.\n\n\n\nPRESENTATION OF ThE GROUP AND ITS ACTIVITIES\nUnique assets in a constantly changing market\n\n14 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n1.\n\n—  Enterprise Portfolio Modernization with Microsoft: \nthis Enterprise Portfolio Modernization (EPM) initiative \nincludes several solutions to support Capgemini’s Cloud \nand Application Development and Maintenance (ADMnext) \nportfolio of assets and services. EPM optimizes enterprise \napplications and enterprise ERPs (enterprise resource \nplanning) and reaps the benefits of cloud economics to \nachieve new business speed and agility. This new initiative \nfocuses on four key solutions based on Azure: Modernize and \nMigrate Legacy Applications, Data Centre Transformation, \nDevelop Cloud-Native Applications and Migrate SAP \napplications to Azure.\n\n—  Factory of the Future (FoF) with Microsoft: this new \ninitiative can accelerate the effectiveness of customers’ \nDigital Manufacturing operations at scale. FoF starts with \nIntelligent Operations Platform (IOP), which integrates \nwith the existing technology stack and can be implemented \nquickly with a set of reference architectures.

With several hundred participants covering AI, Data, Advanced \nAnalytics, IoT, 5G, Intelligent Automation, Edge Computing, AR/\nVR, cybersecurity and Fin-Tech technologies, Capgemini continues \nto maintain a flexible and forward-looking pattern of partnership \nevolution. Over 150+ clients have collaborated with the emerging \npartner ecosystem to create innovative solutions and new business \nvalue.\n\nThrough our global network of Applied Innovation Exchanges, our \necosystem of technology partners constantly work with clients to \nturn innovation into valuable, business-focused solutions at pace.\n\nCapgemini has a global sales and delivery partner network with \ncompanies whose solutions are complementary to our own. Our \nunique expertise, in collaboration with our alliance partners’ \nproducts and services, allows us to build new and valuable business \nsolutions for our clients in less time and with a degree of accuracy \nnot possible without this approach.\n\nOur ecosystem of partners provides critical synergy and are crucial \nto our efforts to solve the toughest challenges for our clients, \nbe it in new business model creation, new technology solution \nimplementation, or progression into new global markets. Our \nalliances and partnerships are generally non-exclusive and can \ngenerate revenue from services we provide to implement their \nproducts, as well as resale of products.\n\nCapgemini’s global ecosystem includes the following partners:\n\n— Adobe\n—  AWS\n—  Dassault \n\nSystèmes\n—  DELL\n— G oogle\n—  Guidewire\n\n—  IBM\n— Intel\n— Microsoft\n—  Oracle\n—  Pega\n—  PTC\n—  Salesforce\n\n —  SAP\n— ServiceNow\n—  Tenemos\n—  UiPath\n—  VMware\n—  Workday\n\n1.2.5  We continually communicate with our stakeholders\n\nCapgemini’s success is built upon on its ability to establish relationships \nof trust with each of its stakeholders, in accordance with its values, \nand its ethics and performance requirements.\n\nAs a committed player in the regions where it operates, the \nGroup strives to communicate regularly with all stakeholders to \nensure that digital and technological transformation is a source \nof long-term growth that takes into account economic, social, \nand environmental challenges. This dialog enables the Group to \nbetter identify and anticipate the sociological and technological \nchanges underway in society, in order to offer solutions that are \nbest adapted to our customers’ needs.\n\nWe establish this communication with our stakeholders on three \nlevels: at the Group level, at the level of its organizational and \nlocal entities, but also at the level of each employee. Capgemini \nhas defined and developed an ad hoc interaction method with \nplayers in each of these five categories:\n\n—  clients: current clients, potential clients, our clients’ \necosystem; \n\n—  talents: employees, local and international work councils, \ncandidates, our employees families and alumni;\n\n—  financial community: shareholders, banks, financial \nanalysts, rating agencies, ESG indices (Environment Social & \nGovernance); \n\n—  business partners: alliances, suppliers, other partners, \nmarket leaders, start-ups, professional or sector \norganizations, standardization organizations; \n\n—  civil society and public authorities: local communities, \nuniversity institutions, opinion leaders, think tanks, local \nauthorities, regulators, legislators including the European \nUnion, citizens, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), \nmedia and international organizations.\n\nIn 2020, Capgemini unveiled its new purpose: “Unleashing human \nenergy through technology for an inclusive and sustainable future.” \nThe Group developed this purpose in collaboration with all its \nstakeholders, especially its employees. A questionnaire was sent \nto employees to gather their opinions and suggestions between \nDecember\xa02019 and May\xa02020. More than 50,000\xa0responses and \n35,000\xa0comments were received and analyzed. Fifteen workshops \nwith young employees in India, the United States, England, Germany, \nand France were also organized. At the same time, the Group \ninterviewed nearly 20\xa0clients, partners, and NGOs in the form of \none-on-one interviews, and gathered the opinions of investors \nthrough an online survey.\n\n\n\nPRESENTATION OF ThE GROUP AND ITS ACTIVITIES\nA strategy to support long‑term growth\n\nCAPGEMINI 15\n\n1.\n\nAttentive to what our talents are saying, our Pulse digital platform \ncollects comments anonymously through regular surveys. More than \n70,000\xa0employees provide their opinions every month. This allows \nus to act quickly and at all levels of the organization to develop a \npersonalized experience for employees, thus improving the Group’s \nappeal. In particular, the platform enabled us to establish regular \nmonitoring for our teams during the Covid-19 crisis. Through \nPulse, we also carried out a first assessment for the onboarding \nof our 50,000\xa0new colleagues following the acquisition of Altran.\n\nFinally, 2020 was a special year when it came to communication with \nshareholders in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. Exceptionally, \nthe Annual General Meeting was held behind closed doors. The \nBoard of Directors, however, ensured that the Annual General \nMeeting remained an important moment of dialog between the \nCompany and its shareholders by offering a mechanism within the \nAnnual General Meeting’s live webcast platform that allowed for \nexchanges between the Board and the shareholders. See Section \n6.5 for more information on dialog with shareholders.\n\n1.3  A strategy to support long‑term growth\n\n1.3.1  Value creation drivers\n\nCapgemini is ideally positioned to capitalize on the growth \nopportunities of the worldwide consulting, IT professional services \nand digital engineering markets with the expertise to help our \nclients transform at scale.\n\nA technology and innovation strategy at the core\n\nWe are proud of our expertise in new technologies: we understand \ntheir potential and the impact they will have on our clients’ business \nactivities. This outstanding expertise is essential in gaining our \nclients’ trust and becoming their chosen transformation partner. We \nassess technology trends with our best global experts in domains \nincluding AI, blockchain, cloud, edge computing, connectivity, \ncybersecurity, data, IoT, 5G, digital twins, and immersive technologies \n(augmented/virtual reality).\n\nWe help enterprises navigate the compelling opportunities for \nbusiness with TechnoVision, our annual technological guide to \nimplement enterprise-ready technology in the complex systems \nof our clients.\n\nSimilarly, our Applied Innovation Exchange (AIE), a global network \ncomposed of 21\xa0innovation labs, provides a controlled environment \nfor organizations to immerse themselves in the understanding, \nexperimentation, and application of emerging technologies.\n\nOur partners, both business and technological, represent a strategic \nasset for Capgemini and our clients. By collaborating closely with \nour partners and through our deep understanding of our clients’ \nbusiness environments, we can create a competitive advantage \nand new business capabilities.\n\nWe constantly adapt our portfolio and strengthen \nour global presence\n\nThroughout 2020 we continued to rotate and evolve our portfolio \nof offerings, as well as growing all of our digital capabilities to \nsupport our client’s digital transformation.\n\nIn 2020 we acquired Advectas to reinforce Business Intelligence and \ndata science capabilities across Scandinavia. In the acquisition of \nWhitesky Labs, one of the largest independent MuleSoft full-service \nconsultancies in the world, our position is significantly strengthened \nin the APAC region while bringing global competencies for the Group.\n\nIn April the Group completed the acquisition of Altran to create a \nglobal digital transformation leader for industrial and technology \ncompanies. The combination will create a unique combination \nof expertise to support the digital transformation of industrial \ncompanies – the market’s most dynamic segment. This would enable \nCapgemini to take the lead in a very promising market segment \n– what we call ‘Intelligent Industry’ or the digital transformation \nof industrial and tech companies.\n\nWe are accelerating our efforts in Intelligent Industry, deploying \nsolutions and services to help clients realize the value of technology \nwithin modern industrial processes, including the launch of Factory of \nthe Future (FoF) with Microsoft which accelerates the effectiveness \nof customers’ Digital Manufacturing operations at scale.\n\nOur people as our best asset\n\nCapgemini’s spirit of conquest and passion for entrepreneurship \non behalf of our clients have always been key for our employees. \nThe women and men of Capgemini are proven experts in their \nfields and are our greatest strength. They are at the frontline of \nbusiness transformation, driving our high-performance culture \nand providing our clients with cutting-edge services. Thanks to \nthem, we are able to ensure high-quality deliverables and reach \nthe most ambitious objectives. In 2020, we continued to invest in \nour people, attract and retain the best in the industry, and offer \nleadership opportunities to our diverse, emerging talents.\n\nWe work hand-in-hand with our clients to help them attain their \nobjectives in terms of innovation, business development, and \neffectiveness and we are passionate about our clients’ challenges. \nOur conviction is that the purpose of a transformation program \nshould not be digital for digital’s sake. It should be driven by specific \nbusiness needs and designed with the optimal architecture to best \ncapture the value from innovation.\n\nWe partner with clients to drive end-to-end transformation enabled \nby our capabilities, which range from innovation, consulting, and \nsystems integration to managed service operations.\n\nMoreover, as a global strategic partner, we believe that in-depth \nindustry knowledge is critical. We align our skills and expertise in \nseven key sectors to transform our clients’ businesses. Our sectorial \nexpertise is detailed in Section\xa01.1.5.\n\n\n\nPRESENTATION OF THE GROUP AND ITS ACTIVITIES\nA strategy to support long-term growth\n\nPRESENTATION OF THE GROUP AND ITS ACTIVITIES\nA strategy to support long-term growth\n\n16 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT CAPGEMINI 17\n\n1.1.\n\nC\nL\nO\nU\nD\n\nD\nA\nT\nA\n\n\n\nPRESENTATION OF ThE GROUP AND ITS ACTIVITIES\nA strategy to support long‑term growth\n\n18 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n1.\n\nOur CSR Strategy\n\nOur ambition is to be recognized globally as a leading responsible \ncompany, using our expertise for positive impact – we want to be \nArchitects of Positive Futures.\n\nCorporate Social Responsibility is a business imperative and is \nembedded as a core component of the Group business strategy. \nIt focuses on 3\xa0key pillars:\n\n1.  Diversity and inclusion: creating an inclusive and performing \nwork environment where our people can thrive, regardless \nof their background (gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, \nage,\xa0etc.); \n\n2.  Digital inclusion: Making the digital revolution an opportunity \nfor all, by reducing the digital divide and providing a bridge \nbetween technology and society;\n\n3.  Environmental sustainability: Minimizing our own \nbusiness-related environmental impacts and supporting our \nclients in their sustainability challenges.\n\nThese three pillars are underpinned by employee engagement which \nis fundamental in order to translate this ambition into reality. We \nencourage our colleagues to play an active part in being Architects \nof Positive Futures.\n\nGiven the importance of CSR, our CSR governance comprises \nsenior executives from across the Group. The Group Executive \nCommittee, the Group Executive Board and the Group Board of \nDirectors are actively involved in the strategy and regularly review \nthe progress made towards our targets.\n\n1.3.2  An adapted investment policy\n\nThe Group continued on a Digital centric strategy with key acquisitions \naiming at reinforcing Capgemini’s leadership in Digital and Cloud.\n\nThe acquisition of Advectas (Business Intelligence and data science \ncapabilities across Scandinavia) and Whitesky Labs (one of the \nlargest independent MuleSoft full-service consultancies in the \nworld) strengthen regional and global competencies for the Group.\n\nThe addition of Purpose, one of the world’s leading social impact \nagencies and hub for campaign innovation brings new strengths to \nCapgemini Invent in helping clients with defining and executing their \npurpose and putting participation at the center of the approach.\n\nIn April the Group completed the acquisition of Altran to create a \nglobal digital transformation leader for industrial and tech companies. \nThe combination will create a unique combination of expertise to \nsupport the digital transformation of industrial companies – the \nmarket’s most dynamic segment. This would enable Capgemini to \ntake the lead in a very promising market segment – what we call \n‘Intelligent Industry’ or the digital transformation of industrial \nand tech companies.\n\nThrough 2021 the Group will continue to evaluate the market \nfor opportunities to strengthen its positions across high-growth \ndomains. These acquisitions will be possible thanks to the Group’s \nvery solid financial position and leading market positions.\n\n1.3.3  Financing policy and financial rating\n\nThe Capgemini financing policy is intended to provide the Group \nwith adequate financial flexibility and is based on the following \nmain criteria:\n\n—  a moderate use of debt leveraging over the past ten years \nCapgemini has striven to maintain at all times a limited level \nof net debt, including in the manner in which it finances its \nexternal growth; \n\n—  diversified financing sources adapted to the Group’s financial \nprofile: Capgemini bases its financing around “bank” sources \n(mainly a €750\xa0 million multi-currency syndicated credit \nfacility undrawn at December\xa0 31, 2020 and refinanced in \nFebruary\xa0 2021) and “market” sources (€7,700\xa0 million in \nbonds principal at December\xa0 31, 2020 and a €1,000\xa0 million \nshort-term negotiable debt securities program, of which \n€350\xa0million were drawn at December\xa031, 2020);\n\n—  a good level of liquidity and sustainable financial resources, \nwhich means:\n\n–  maintaining an adequate level of available funds \n(€3,174\xa0million at December\xa031, 2020), supplemented by \na €750\xa0 million multi-currency syndicated credit facility \nsecured on July\xa030, 2014 and maturing on July\xa027, 2021. \nThis facility was refinanced on February\xa09, 2021 by a new \n€1,000\xa0 million multi-currency syndicated credit facility \nmaturing on February\xa09, 2026,\n\n–  borrowings with maturities up to 2032, with only a \nlimited portion falling due within 12\xa0months (contractual \ncash flows within less than one year – see Note\xa022\xa0to the \nconsolidated financial statements) representing just 11% \nof total contractual cash flows at December\xa031, 2020,\n\n —  Financial rating \n\nThe Group’s ability to access financial and banking markets and \nthe cost of accessing such markets depend at least in part on the \ncredit rating awarded by the rating agency Standard & Poor’s.

The \nreport, published prior to the outbreak, is even more pertinent in \nthe current context as governments increasingly move resources \nonline, and having internet access is becoming a prerequisite to \naccessing essential public services – including critical healthcare \ninformation.\n\n\n\nPRESENTATION OF ThE GROUP AND ITS ACTIVITIES\nSolid performance in 2020\n\nCAPGEMINI 27\n\n1.\n\n1.5.3  Consolidated financial statements\n\n2016 \nreported (1)  \n\n2017  \nrestated (1)  (in millions of euros) 2018 2019** 2020*** \n\nRevenues 12,539 12,525 13,197 14,125 15,848 \n\nOperating expenses (11,099) (11,032) (11,600) (12,384) (13,969) \n\nOperating margin* 1,440 1,493 1,597 1,741 1,879 \n\n% of revenues 11.5% 11.9% 12.1% 12.3% 11.9% \n\nOperating profit 1,148 1,183 1,251 1,433 1,502 \n\n% of revenues 9.2% 9.4% 9.5% 10.1% 9.5% \n\nProfit for the period attributable to owners of the Company (2) 921 820 730 856 957 \n\n% of revenues 7.3% 6.6% 5.5% 6.0% 6.1% \n\nEarnings per share\n\nAverage number of shares outstanding during the period 169,450,721 168,057,561 167,088,363 166,171,198 167,620,101 \n\nBasic earnings per share (in euros) 5.44 4.88 4.37 5.15, 5.71 \n\nNormalized earnings per share* (in euros) (2) 6.69 6.22 (3) 6.06 (3) 6.76 (3) 7.23 \n\nDividend per share for the year (in euros) 1.55 1.70 1.70 1.35 1.95 (4)  \n\nGoodwill (at December\xa031) 7,176 6,830 7,431 7,662 9,795 \n\nEquity attributable to owners of the Company (at December\xa031) 7,272 6,956 7,480 8,424 6,103 \n\n(Net debt)/net cash and cash equivalents* (at December\xa031) (1,413) (1,209) (1,184) (600) (4,904) \n\nOrganic free cash flow* (at December\xa031) 1,071 1,080 1,160 1,288 1,119 \n\nAverage number of employees 185,593 196,755 204,904 216,104 251,525 \n\nNumber of employees (at December\xa031) 193,077 199,698 211,313 219,314 269,769 \n\n     \n\n(1) Only 2017 figures have been restated for the retrospective application of IFRS\xa015, Revenue from contracts with customers, effective starting January\xa01, 2018.\n(2) Including tax income (net) of €180\xa0million in respect of goodwill arising on legal restructurings.\n(3) Excluding a tax expense of €53\xa0million in 2018, €60\xa0million in 2019 and tax income of €8\xa0million in 2020 due to the transitional impact of the 2017 US tax reform.\n(4) Subject to approval by the Shareholders’ Meeting of May\xa020, 2021.\n* The alternative performance measures monitored by the Group (operating margin, normalized earnings per share, net debt/net cash and cash equivalents and organic free \n\ncash flow) are defined in Note\xa03 – Alternative performance measures and broken down in Note\xa011 – Earnings per share, Note\xa022 – Net debt/net cash and cash equivalents \nand Note\xa023 – Cash flows.\n\n** 2019 data reflects the application of IFRS\xa016, Leases, using the modified retrospective method.\n*** 2020 data reflects the consolidation of Altran from April\xa01, 2020.\n\n\n\nPRESENTATION OF ThE GROUP AND ITS ACTIVITIES\nSolid performance in 2020\n\n28 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n1.\n\n1.5.4  Non‑financial achievements\n\n 2018 2019 2020 \n2020  \n\nscope \n\nAverage total headcount 204,904 216,104 251,525 C+A \n\nNumber of people hired by the Group (external hiring) 61,752 63,728 47,002 C+A \n\nShare of women in the workforce (%) 31.9 33 34.9\n33.7 \n\nC\nC+A \n\nShare of Vice-President promotions that are women  \n(internal promotions and external hiring) (%) \n\n24 29 30 A \n\nTotal number of training hours (millions) (1) 8.2 9.2 9.8\n1.1 \n\nC\nA \n\nAlignment of social impact projects towards digital inclusion (%) 64 74 87 A \n\n% change in greenhouse gas emissions per employee vs 2015 baseline \n(location-based) (%) \n\n- - 29.9 - 71.2 A \n\nShare of operations by headcount covered by ISO\xa014001\xa0certification  \n(% operations by headcount)\n\n87 91.4\n31.1\n\n80\n\n97.8\n32.7\n\n85.9, \n\nC\nA\n\nC+A \n\nOfice energy eficiency (kWh/m²) -\n-\n\n151.3\n147.3\n\n97.3\n116.6\n\nC\nA\n\n- 136.5 89.5 C+A \n\nScope: (C) stands for Capgemini legacy, (A) stands for Altran legacy and (C+A) for Capgemini and Altran.\n(1) Note: There has been a change in methodology in how learning hours are reported from 2018 to 2019.

administration\n\n2.1.1  History\n\nThe Capgemini group was founded over 50\xa0years ago in 1967 \nby Mr. Serge Kampf, who was still honorary Chairman and Vice-\nChairman at the time of his death on March\xa015, 2016. Capgemini was \nmarked by his quite exceptional personality. he was an exceptional \nentrepreneur and a captain of industry the likes of which are rarely \nseen. In 1967, he was among the first to understand the role of an \nIT services company. he had taken the Group to the top of its sector \nwhen he handed Mr. Paul hermelin the Executive Management of \nthe Group in 2002, followed by the Chair of the Board in 2012. he \nbuilt the Group based on principles that still apply today: a spirit of \nenterprise, a passion for clients, an obsession to help employees \ngrow, ethical conduct at all times and performance at its best.\n\nThe story of this half-century can be split into four major periods:\n\n —  period one (1967‑1996):  \n29 years of independence\n\nSogeti was created in Grenoble in October\xa01967 as a “traditional” \nlimited liability company, managed nearly 30\xa0years by the same \nChairman and Chief Executive Oficer, Mr. Serge Kampf, its founder \nand the uncontested leader of a brilliant team of managers that he \nformed around him and never ceased to promote. Fully conscious \nthat the Group – if it were to attain the increasingly ambitious \nobjectives that he set each year – could not restrict much longer \nits financial capacities to those of its founding Chairman, Mr. Serge \nKampf finally accepted in January\xa01996 under friendly pressure \nfrom the two other “main” shareholders (CGIP, a partner since 1988  \nand Daimler Benz, shareholder since 1991):\n\n—  to propose to the Shareholders’ Meeting of May\xa0 24, 1996 \nthe merger-absorption within Capgemini of the two holding \ncompanies that had until then enabled him to retain majority \ncontrol; \n\n— t o participate (personally in the amount of FRF 300\xa0 million) \nin a share capital increase of FRF 2.1\xa0billion, with the balance \nsubscribed in equal parts (FRF 900\xa0million) by Daimler and CGIP; \n\n—  and finally to transfer the head ofice from Grenoble to Paris.\n\nIn May\xa0 1996, at the end of this initial period, the Group had \n25,000\xa0employees (7,000 in France, nearly 4,000 in the United \nStates, some 12,000 in the triangle formed by the UK, Benelux \nand the Nordic countries and around 2,000\xa0across approximately \n10\xa0other countries) – a 625-fold increase on its initial headcount! \n– and reported annual revenues of approximately FRF 13\xa0billion \n(€2\xa0billion), i.e. per capita revenues of around FRF 520,000 (€80,000).\n\n —  period two (1996‑2002):  \na changing shareholding structure\n\nOn May\xa024, 1996, as announced in January to key Group managers, \nMr. Serge Kampf presented his proposals to the Shareholders’ \nMeeting which adopted them with a large majority. Just after, \na two-tier structure – more familiar to the German shareholder \nthan the French société anonyme – was introduced for a four-year \nperiod, with Mr. Serge Kampf as Chairman of the Management \nBoard and Mr. Klaus Mangold (Daimler-Benz) as Chairman of the \nSupervisory Board. One year later, following Daimler-Benz’s decision \nto refocus on its core businesses (a decision confirmed soon after \nby the spectacular takeover of Chrysler), this latter was replaced by \nMr. Ernest-Antoine Seillière, Chairman of CGIP (now the principal \nshareholder of the Group, with 30% of the share capital). At the \nend of this four-year period, the Shareholders’ Meeting of May\xa023, \n2000 held to approve the 1999 financial statements decided not \nto renew this two-tier governance structure and to reinstate Mr. \nSerge Kampf in his duties as Chairman and Chief Executive Oficer \nand to create at his request a position of general manager, which \nhad never really existed within the Group. The first holder of this \nposition was Mr. Geoff Unwin, already considered to be the Group’s \nnumber two within the Management Board.\n\nAt the end of the 1990s, having recovered its independence, \nCapgemini benefited fully from the euphoria generated by the \n“internet bubble”, the Year 2000 and the birth of the Euro. The \nGroup had great ambitions. A major milestone was reached in 2000 \nwith the acquisition of Ernst & Young Consulting, making Capgemini \na new global leader in its sector and consolidating its positions in \nthe United States. however, the Group was hit hard by the 2001 \neconomic crisis triggered by the burst of the internet bubble and \ndificulties integrating Ernst & Young Consulting.\n\nIn December\xa02001, after a difficult year whose disappointing \nresults only confirmed the threat of recession hanging over the \nglobal economy at that time, the Group had 55,000\xa0employees \nand reported annual revenues of around €7\xa0billion, i.e. per capita \nrevenues of approximately €125,000, more than 50% above that of \nthe first period but merely the reflection of the incorporation in the \nheadcount in May\xa02000 of 16,643\xa0consultants from Ernst & Young.\n\nTaking note of the decision made – and confirmed – by Mr. \nGeoff Unwin to retire in the near future, the Board of Directors \ndecided, at the recommendation of its Chairman, to appoint as \nhis replacement Mr. Paul hermelin, who became Group general \nmanager alongside Mr. Serge Kampf, Chairman and Chief Executive \nOficer, on January\xa01, 2002.\n\n —  period three (2002‑2012):  \na well‑prepared transfer of power\n\nOn July\xa024, 2002, Mr. Serge Kampf took the initiative to recommend \nto the Board of Directors – which accepted – to separate the \nfunctions of Chairman and Chief Executive Oficer, as recently \nmade possible by the New Economic Regulations Law (NRE). he \nconsidered that after creating, expanding, leading and managing \nthe Group for 35\xa0years, the time had come for him to give more \npower and visibility to the person he considered the best qualified \nto succeed him one day. This two-man team operated eficiently \nand in harmony for 10\xa0years, although, according to Mr. Serge \nKampf, this was due more to the relationship of trust, friendship \nand mutual respect between the two individuals than what the NRE \nsays regarding the respective roles, powers and responsibilities of \nthe Chairman and the Chief Executive Oficer.\n\nDespite the heavy storm which battered the Group during the first \nfour years of this period, the Group invested considerable sums \nin major restructuring operations, the most obvious outcome of \nwhich was the reinvigoration of all Group companies: for example, \nat the end of 2011, the Group had 120,000\xa0employees (compared \nwith 55,000\xa0employees 10\xa0years previously) and reported revenues \nof €10\xa0billion compared with €7\xa0billion in 2001.\n\n —  period four (2012 to this day):  \na new dimension for the Group\n\nCapgemini has had the same goal since 1967: helping businesses \nto be more eficient, innovative and agile through technology. \nSince its foundation, Capgemini has been known for its boldness, \nand its desire to build, develop and help its employees grow, to \nbest serve its clients.\n\nOn April\xa04, 2012, as he had already implied two years previously \non the renewal of his term of ofice, Mr. Serge Kampf informed \ndirectors that “after having enjoyed the benefits of separation for \n10\xa0years” he had decided to place this ofice back in the hands of \nthe Board of Directors. he recommended a return at this time to \nthe “standard” method of governance (that of a company in which \nthe duties of Chairman and Chief Executive Oficer are exercised \nby the same individual) and the appointment as Chairman and \nChief Executive Oficer of the current Chief Executive Oficer, \nMr. Paul hermelin, who had widely demonstrated, throughout a \n“probationary period” of a rather exceptional length, his ability \nto hold this role.\n\n\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE \nCompany management and administration\n\n32 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n2.\n\nAt its meeting of April\xa04, 2012, the Board followed these recommendations \nand solemnly conferred on Mr. Serge Kampf the title of “honorary \nChairman” and function of Vice-Chairman, which he retained until his \ndeath on March\xa015, 2016. At the Shareholders’ Meeting of May\xa024, \n2012, Mr. Serge Kampf passed the torch to Mr. Paul hermelin, \nwho became Chairman and Chief Executive Oficer of Capgemini. \n“The Group is assured to continue its great story”, emphasized its \nfounder at this time. The Shareholders’ Meeting gave a standing \novation in honor of Mr. Serge Kampf’s immense contribution to the \ndevelopment and reputation of the Company. Since the appointment \nof Mr. Paul hermelin as Chief Executive Oficer in 2002 and then \nas Chairman and Chief Executive Oficer in 2012, and the return to \ngrowth in 2004, the Group has set a course for new horizons. Firstly \ngeographic, with expansion in India, the keystone of the Group’s \nindustrialization process. Two major milestones were reached \nwith the acquisition of Kanbay in 2007 followed by IGATE in 2015, \nboth US Financial Services specialists with a strong presence in \nIndia. The Group also expanded in Brazil, taking control of CPM \nBraxis in 2010, a leading Brazilian player. These new horizons are \nalso technological. The Group launched new offerings integrating \nmajor changes such as Cloud computing, Digital and big data and \nmeeting cyber security challenges.\n\nIn 2018, the Group remodeled its organization in line with the new \nambitions set by the Board of Directors and Group Management: the \nmaturity achieved by all the business lines now enables the Group \nto be organized around the client relationship. This organization \n\nenables Capgemini to better draw on the full range of its expertise \nand develops synergies between businesses, offerings and the \ngeographical areas where the Group serves its clients.\n\nFollowing the acquisition in April\xa02020 of Altran, a global leader \nin engineering and R&D services, Capgemini and Altran formed \na global digital transformation leader for industrial and tech \ncompanies, ready to deploy the full promise of Intelligent Industry. \nThis new group enjoys a unique position for bringing the power of \nnew technologies and data to leading industrial and technology \nplayers across the globe.\n\nIt was in this dynamic context that the Board of Directors’ meeting \nof September\xa016, 2019 chose Mr. Aiman Ezzat, Chief Operating \nOficer, to succeed Mr. Paul hermelin as Chief Executive Oficer \nat the end of the Shareholders’ Meeting of May\xa020, 2020. This \ndecision was taken after a management succession internal \nprocess launched in 2017. A governance structure separating the \nduties of Chairman and Chief Executive Oficer, under which Mr. \nPaul hermelin remained Chairman of the Board and Mr. Aiman \nEzzat became Chief Executive Oficer of the Company, as the sole \nExecutive Corporate Oficer, was therefore implemented by the \nBoard of Directors following the Shareholders’ Meeting of May\xa020, \n2020. With this new governance structure, Capgemini will write the \nnext Chapter in its history with the passion and collective energy \nthat characterize the Group, and continue making Capgemini a \nglobal and responsible leader in its sector.\n\n2.1.2  Governance structure\n\nBALANCED GOVERNANCE, TAILORED TO CAPGEMINI’S SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS\n\nThe Company’s Board of Directors seeks to implement a balanced \ngovernance structure tailored to Capgemini and able to adapt to \nthe circumstances and challenges specific to the Group, as well \nas changes in best practices in this area. It chooses between two \ngeneral management approaches: combining or separating the \nduties of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Oficer.\n\nChange in governance method – management \nsuccession prepared since 2017\n\nGovernance method since May 2020\n\nBetween May\xa02012 and May\xa02020 the Board of Directors implemented \na governance structure combining together the duties of Chairman \nand Chief Executive Oficer, exercised by Mr. Paul hermelin.\n\nIn 2012 and then in May\xa02014 and May\xa02018 on the renewal of Mr. \nPaul hermelin’s terms of ofice, the Board considered this method \nof governance combining together the duties of Chairman of the \nBoard of Directors and Chief Executive Oficer to be the most \nappropriate.\n\nAs part of the management succession launched as early as 2017, \nthe Board of Directors considered in 2018 that the continued \ncombination of the duties of Chairman of the Board of Directors \nand Chief Executive Officer enabled both preparations to be \nmade for the future and coherence and consistency between \nthe Board of Directors and Group Management to be maintained \nthroughout the management transition phase announced during \nthe 2018 Shareholders’ Meeting and to terminate at the end of \nthe 2020 Shareholders’ Meeting with the separation of the duties \nof Chairman and Chief Executive Oficer.\n\nThe Board of Directors also considered that a satisfactory balance \nof power existed within the Board of Directors. The Board noted \nin particular:\n\n—  the role of the Lead Independent Director, entrusted with \nspecific prerogatives and duties since Mai 2014; \n\n— t he presence of a large majority of Independent Directors on \nthe Board; \n\n—  the existence of four specialized board committees with \ndifferent remits encompassing Audit & Risk, Compensation, \nEthics & Governance and Strategy & CSR; and\n\n—  the restrictions introduced by the Board of Directors’ Charter \non the powers of the Chief Executive Oficer by requiring the \nprior approval by the Board of Directors of major strategic \ndecisions and decisions likely to have a material impact on \nthe Company.\n\nManagement succession\n\nA management succession internal process was launched in 2017 \nby the Board of Directors at the initiative of Mr. Paul hermelin, \nChairman and Chief Executive Oficer. Following a review of the \nGroup’s key talents and external candidates based on an assignment \nconducted by an external consultant and individual meetings, \nthe Board of Directors, on the proposal of Mr. Paul hermelin and \nthe Ethics & Governance Committee, appointed Messrs. Thierry \nDelaporte and Aiman Ezzat as Chief Operating Oficers with effect \nfrom January\xa01, 2018. The Vice-Chairman of the Board and Chairman \nof the Strategy & Investment Committee (renamed the Strategy & \nCSR Committee in March\xa02019), Mr. Daniel Bernard, was tasked with \npreparing the changes in the Group’s governance. he was assisted \nby an ad hoc committee comprising Mr. Xavier Musca (Chairman of \nthe Audit & Risk Committee) (who replaced Mr. Bruno Roger in the \nad hoc committee from May\xa02018), Mr. Pierre Pringuet (Chairman \nof the Ethics & Governance Committee and Lead Independent \nDirector) and himself.\n\n\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE \nCompany management and administration\n\nCAPGEMINI 33\n\n2.\n\nAt its meeting of September\xa016, 2019, the Board of Directors chose \nMr. Aiman Ezzat, Chief Operating Oficer, to succeed Mr. Paul hermelin \nas Chief Executive Oficer at the end of the Shareholders’ Meeting of \nMay\xa020, 2020.

Accordingly, the percentage of independent \ndirectors on the Capgemini\xa0SE Board of Directors at the date of \nthis Universal Registration Document, is calculated based on \n12\xa0members and not the full 15\xa0members of the Board.\n\nReview of director independence by the Board of Directors\n\nBased on the report of the Ethics & Governance Committee, the \nBoard of Directors examined the personal situation of each of the \nmembers of the Board of Directors with regard to the AFEP-MEDEF \nCode independence criteria set-out above during its meeting of \nFebruary\xa017, 2021.\n\nThe following table summarizes the classification adopted for each \ndirector following this review, for the 12\xa0directors included in the \ncalculation of the Board’s independence ratio in accordance with \nthe AFEP-MEDEF Code.\n\n \n\nIs not and has \nnot been within \nthe last 5 years, \n\nan employee \nor Executive \n\nCorporate \nOfficer\n\nNo cross‑ \ndirectorships\n\nNo material \nbusiness \n\nrelationships\n\nNo  \nfamily \n\nties\n\nHas not been \nthe statutory \n\nauditor of  \nthe Company  \n\nin the last \n5 years\n\nHas not  \nbeen a \n\ndirector for \nmore than \n\n12 years Classification\n\nPaul hermelin x √ √ √ √ x Not independent\n\nAiman Ezzat x √ √ √ √ √ Not independent\n\nDaniel Bernard √ √ √ √ √ x Not independent\n\nAnne Bouverot √ √ √ √ √ √ Independent\n\nXiaoqun Clever √ √ √ √ √ √ Independent\n\nLaurence Dors √ √ √ √ √ √ Independent\n\nSiân herbert-Jones √ √ √ √ √ √ Independent\n\nBelen Moscoso del Prado √ √ √ √ √ √ Independent\n\nXavier Musca √ √ √ √ √ √ Independent\n\nFrédéric Oudéa √ √ √ √ √ √ Independent\n\nPatrick Pouyanné √ √ √ √ √ √ Independent\n\nPierre Pringuet √ √ √ √ √ √ Independent\n\nTOTAL 9 INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS (75%)\n\nx  Independence criteria not met. \n√ Independence criteria met.\n\nBased on the independence criteria set out above, the Board \nconsidered that 9\xa0 of its 12\xa0 members (excluding directors \nrepresenting employees and employee shareholders), i.e. 75%, \ncould be considered independent:\n\nAnne Bouverot, Xiaoqun Clever, Laurence Dors, Siân herbert-Jones, \nBelen Moscoso del Prado, Xavier Musca, Frédéric Oudéa, Patrick \nPouyanné and Pierre Pringuet.\n\nSpecific review by the Board of Directors of the business \nrelationship criteria between Capgemini group and its \ndirectors\n\nDuring its annual review of the independence of directors, the Board \nof Directors examined, in particular, any business relationships \nbetween Capgemini group and each director or company with \nwhich they are associated, in order to assess the materiality of \nthese relationships.\n\nThis assessment was conducted with regard to both quantitative \nand qualitative criteria.\n\n\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE \nCompany management and administration\n\nCAPGEMINI 41\n\n2.\n\nThe quantitative assessment was based on a statement of business \nflows between Capgemini group and entities that are suppliers \nand/or clients of Capgemini and that have directors in common \nwith Capgemini\xa0SE.\n\nThis analysis is supplemented by a review of more qualitative \nand contextual items reflecting the situations examined, such as \nnegotiation terms and conditions for the delivery of services, the \norganization of the relationship between stakeholders and the \nrelevant director’s position in the contracting company and the \nexistence of a long-term relationship or a position of potential \neconomic dependence.\n\nThis review is one of the specific activities conducted by the Lead \nIndependent Director as part of the procedure to assess the absence \nof conflict of interest (see below).\n\nAfter assessing the above criteria and based on the work of the \nEthics & Governance Committee, the Board of Directors concluded \nas follows:\n\n—  in 2020, Capgemini\xa0SE and its subsidiaries have, in the normal \ncourse of business, delivered services to and/or received \nservices from companies in which certain of its independent \ndirectors are executives or directors; \n\n—  in addition, Capgemini\xa0 SE received some services from \ncompanies in which certain of its independent directors are \nexecutives or directors in the context of the Altran Technologies \npublic tender offer. These agreements were classified as \nregulated agreements due to the non-current nature of the \nacquisition project (see pages 316 and 338 for a description \nof these agreements); \n\n—  nonetheless, to the extent that the services were contracted \nunder normal conditions (including for the agreements\nclassified as regulated agreements in the context of the Altran \nTechnologies acquisition project due to their non-current nature) \nand that the corresponding revenues recognized by Capgemini \n\n \n\n(1) Following the repeal of the so-called “trading” exception due to the enactment into French law of the revised Transparency Directive 2013/50/EU by Order no. 2015-1576 of \nDecember\xa03, 2015, service providers must include in their threshold crossing disclosures certain agreements or financial instruments deemed to have an economic effect \nsimilar to the ownership of shares, irrespective of whether they are settled in shares or cash (e.g. forward purchases with physical settlement).\n\n(2) the Company was also notified in accordance with Article 10\xa0of the bylaws that between January\xa01, 2020 and February\xa017, 2021, the date of review by the Board of Directors, \nCACIB had successively increased, decreased and increased its interest above and below the threshold of 6% of the Company’s share capital and voting rights.\n\nand the relevant companies could not be considered material \nor to indicate a position of economic dependence, in the Board \nof Directors’ opinion these business relationships were not \nmaterial for Capgemini group or the relevant companies \nand did not indicate a situation of economic dependence or \nexclusivity and were not likely to compromise the independence \nof the directors concerned.\n\nIn addition to procedures performed prior to entering into service \nagreements, a specific review was performed of relations with \nCrédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank (CACIB), which \nreported increasing its interest above the legal threshold of 5% \nof the Company’s share capital and voting rights on December\xa017, \n2020. CACIB is a subsidiary of Crédit Agricole\xa0SA, whose Chief \nExecutive Oficer is Mr. Xavier Musca. CACIB reported that it held \n5.92% of the share capital and voting rights at December\xa017, 2020 \nand indicated that the 5% threshold was crossed following the \nconclusion of an agreement and financial instruments relating to \nthe Company (1) (2).\n\nThe Board of Directors noted that CACIB acted as the structuring bank \nfor the most recent Group employee share ownership transactions \nand that implementing the leveraged and secure offers requires \nthe financial institution structuring the offer to enter into on and \noff-market hedging transactions, by buying and/or selling shares, \nshare purchase options and/or all other transactions throughout \nthe duration of the transactions.\n\nThe Board of Directors concluded that these factors were not likely \nto compromise Mr. Xavier Musca’s independence.\n\nIndependence of the Board after the 2021 Shareholders’ \nMeeting\n\nAssuming the Shareholders’ Meeting of May\xa020, 2021 renews the term \nof ofice of Mr. Patrick Pouyanné and appoints Ms.\xa0Tanja Rueckert \nand Mr. Kurt Sievers, the percentage of independent directors on \nthe Board from this date will be 82% (i.e. 9\xa0members out of 11).\n\nOverview of the independent status of the Board of Directors\n\n \n\nPercentage of \nindependent \n\ndirectors* Classification of Board members**\n\nAt the date of the 2020 Universal \nRegistration Document\n\n75% Anne Bouverot, Xiaoqun Clever, Laurence Dors, Siân Herbert‑Jones, \nBelen Moscoso del Prado, Xavier Musca, Frédéric Oudéa, Patrick \nPouyanné and Pierre Pringuet\n\nPaul hermelin, Daniel Bernard and Aiman Ezzat\n\nAt the end of the Shareholders’ \nMeeting of May\xa020, 2021\n\n82% Xiaoqun Clever, Laurence Dors, Siân Herbert‑Jones, Belen Moscoso del \nPrado, Xavier Musca, Frédéric Oudéa, Patrick Pouyanné, Tanja Rueckert \nand Kurt Sievers\n\nPaul hermelin, and Aiman Ezzat\n\n* Directors representing employees and employee shareholders are not included in this percentage in accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code.\n** In bold: members considered independent by the Board.\n\nInformation on regulated agreements with related parties\n\nAgreements governed by Article L.\xa0225-38\xa0of the French Commercial \nCode were authorized by the Board of Directors during the year \nended December\xa031, 2020.

After analyzing the criteria adopted to classify \nagreements as regulated agreements or ordinary agreements \nperformed at arm’s length during the fiscal year, the Ethics & \nGovernance Committee did not recommend the modification by \nthe Board of Directors of the agreement classification criteria in \nthe Internal Charter.\n\nAbsence of conflict of interest\n\nArticle 7.1\xa0of the Capgemini\xa0SE Board of Directors’ Charter requires \ndirectors to comply with recommendation no. 20\xa0of the AFEP-\nMEDEF Code concerning the prevention of conflicts of interest:\n\n“Although they are themselves shareholders, the directors represent \nall the shareholders and are required to act in all circumstances in \nthe Company’s interest. They are required to notify the Board of \nDirectors of any one-off conflict of interest or potential conflict \nof interest and to refrain from participating in deliberations and \nvoting on the related decision. Any director who has a permanent \nconflict of interest is required to resign from the Board.”\n\nFurthermore, in light of the recommendations of the French \nFinancial Markets Authority (AMF) and the Corporate Governance \nhigh Committee, the Board of Directors implemented an appraisal \nprocedure to assess any conflicts of interest that may arise from \nbusiness relations.\n\nTo this end, a statement of business flows between Capgemini \ngroup and entities that are suppliers and/or clients of Capgemini \ngroup and that have directors in common with Capgemini\xa0SE is \nprepared annually and communicated to Mr. Pierre Pringuet, Lead \nIndependent Director and Chairman of the Ethics & Governance \nCommittee. A qualitative assessment of situations encountered is \nalso conducted based on several criteria, as detailed in the Section \n“Independence of the Board of Directors” above. In addition, each \nyear directors are required to issue a statement to the Company \nregarding the existence or absence, to their knowledge, of any \nconflicts of interest.\n\nBased on this information, the Lead Independent Director confirmed \nthe absence of any conflicts of interest.\n\nThese conflict of interest prevention measures supplement one of \nthe general duties of the Ethics & Governance Committee which is \nto draw the attention of the Chairman of the Board of Directors \n\nto any potential situations of conflict of interest it has identified \nbetween a director and the Company or its Group or between \ndirectors.

In a constantly changing global \nmarket with a skills shortage, Capgemini believes diversity drives \ninnovation and creativity. A range of diverse profiles and inclusive \npractices in our work environment are key to ensuring the Group \nremains attractive and guaranteeing its long-term success.\n\nAs part of its CSR strategy and to accompany these changes, the \nGroup decided the following regarding diversity in its management \nbodies:\n\n—  to set the objective of a progressive increase in both female \nand international representation on the Group’s Executive \nCommittee; \n\n—  as of Jan 1, 2021, the international representation on the \nGroup Executive Committee is at 52% or 15\xa0members out of \n29\xa0members; \n\n—  with regard to female representation, this has led to a steady \nincrease since 2016 in the percentage of women in this \nmanagement body, rising successively from below 10% in \n2016 to 24% in 2018, 26.9% in 2019 and 27.6% in 2020 post \nAltran integration. The long-term objective is to achieve the \nsame percentage of women in the Executive Committee as in \nthe Group’s headcount; \n\n—  to increase female representation in the 10% of positions \nwith the greatest responsibility within Group executive \nleaders and, more widely in the Vice-President community, \nby similarly setting annual objectives in this respect for the \nGroup’s key managers. In 2018, 14% of Group executive leader \npositions were held by women. The percentage at the end of \n2019 went up to 17%. The target for 2020 was to increase \nthis percentage to 20%. The percentage achieved at the end \nof 2020 was 20.3% and hereafter the objective is to reach a \npercentage of 30% by 2025 representing a 2\xa0pts increase per \nannum over the period, being specified that our long-term \nobjective for Group executive leaders is similar to the one set \nfor Executive Committee i.e. to achieve the same percentage \nof women in this population, as in the Group’s headcount.\n\n These objectives will be combined with the strengthening of the \nGroup’s internal policies to ensure the implementation of regular \nand fair practices supporting this strategic direction, enabling \ndiversified and non-discriminatory global representation at all levels \nof the organization. A specific focus will be placed on gender equality, \nwith a long-term objective of progressively aligning the percentage \nof female senior executives with the overall percentage of women \nin the Vice-President population.\n\nA more detailed description of our policies and indicators for gender \ndiversity in general, as well as the measures taken to increase the \npercentage of women in management positions, is presented in \nChapter\xa04\xa0of the 2020 Universal Registration Document.\n\nAs part of various duties, the Capgemini\xa0SE Board of Directors \nmonitors the implementation by Group Management of this \npolicy of non-discrimination and diversity, notably with regard to \nthe balanced representation of men and women on the Group’s \nmanagement bodies.\n\nThe Group’s CSR strategy, which is monitored specifically since \nOctober\xa02018 by the Strategy & CSR Committee, and which includes \ndiversity as a key pillar, is reviewed annually by the Board of Directors. \nIn addition, new duties were entrusted to the Compensation \nCommittee since 2019 to ensure the implementation of the diversity \npolicy for management bodies. The various diversity quantified \nindicators are verified by an external expert as part of the Report \non non-financial performance.\n\nFinally, the Board of Directors has set Executive Corporate Oficers \nobjectives to increase female representation in the Group in the \nvariable part of their annual compensation and, since 2018, the \nBoard of Directors includes a criterion applicable to performance \nshares granted to Executive Corporate Oficers and Group managers \ntargeting an increase in the number of women becoming Vice-\nPresident.\n\nSee Section\xa02.3\xa0of this Universal Registration Document for more \ninformation on the individual objectives of the Executive Corporate \nOfficers – Diversity is included in the objective concerning the roll‑out \nof the Group’s CSR strategy; and the description of the criteria \napplicable to performance shares granted in 2020 in the Note\xa012\xa0of \nfinancial statements.\n\n\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE \nCompany management and administration\n\nCAPGEMINI 67\n\n2.\n\n2.1.6  Transactions carried out in the company’s shares\n\nTransactions carried out in 2020 in the company’s shares or related financial instruments by the individuals referred to in Article \nL.\xa0621-18-2\xa0of the French Financial and Monetary Code, of which the Company is aware, are as follows\xa0:\n\n Transaction Transaction date\n\nAverage \nprice  \n\n(in euros) \nReport  \nreference\n\nPaul Hermelin\nChairman of the Board  \nof Directors  \n(since May\xa020, 2020)\n\nGift of 80,000\xa0shares July\xa031, 2020 67.5511 2020 DD695952\n\nGift of 19,600\xa0shares July\xa031, 2020 102.8500 2021 DD729076\n\nGift of 35,000\xa0shares August\xa03, 2020 26.3500 2020 DD695967\n\nVesting of 28,000\xa0performance shares  \n(Plan dated 10/05/2017)\n\nOctober\xa05, 2020 0.00 2020 DD704168\n\nSale of 12,500\xa0shares (performance shares \nreceived in 2012 and vested in 2015)\n\nOctober\xa08, 2020 110.8656 2020 DD704167\n\nThierry Delaporte  \nChief Operating Oficer  \n(until December\xa031, 2019)\n\nSale of 19,800\xa0shares January\xa03, 2020 109.4446 2020 DD664279\n\nAiman Ezzat  \nChief Executive Oficer  \n(since May\xa020, 2020)\n\nVesting of 16,000\xa0performance shares  \n(Plan dated 10/05/2017)\n\nOctober\xa05, 2020 0.00 2020 DD704269\n\nSubscription of 67.0701 FCPE “ESOP \nCapgemini” units (2020 employee share \nownership plan)\n\nDecember\xa017, 2020 92.93 2020 DD725066\n\nCarole Ferrand  \nChief Financial Oficer\n\nSubscription of 59.6324 FCPE “ESOP \nCapgemini” units (2020 employee share \nownership plan)\n\nDecember\xa017, 2020 92.93 2020 DD724894\n\nHervé Jeannin  \nDirector representing \nemployees\n\nSubscription of 9.0534 FCPE “ESOP \nCapgemini” units (2020 employee share \nownership plan)\n\nDecember\xa017, 2020 92.93 2020 DD725082\n\nKevin Masters  \nDirector representing \nemployees\n\nSubscription of 12.1835 FCPE “ESOP \nCapgemini” units (2020 employee share \nownership plan)\n\nDecember\xa017, 2020 92.93 2020 DD724931\n\nBelen Moscoso del Prado\nDirector\n\nPurchase of 1,000\xa0shares June\xa04, 2020 91.1540 2020 DD686721\n\nLucia Sinapi  \nDirector\n\nSale of 2,130\xa0shares September\xa08, 2020 114.9517 2020 DD699724\n\nSale of 4,000\xa0shares September\xa014, 2020 118.4495 2020 DD700566\n\nVesting of 2,400\xa0performance shares  \n(Plan dated 10/05/2017)\n\nOctober\xa05, 2020 0.00 2020 DD704164\n\nSubscription of 39.8966 FCPE “ESOP \nCapgemini” units (2020 employee  \nshare ownership plan)\n\nDecember\xa017, 2020 92.93 2020 DD725169\n\n\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE \nOrganization and activities of the Board of Directors\n\n68 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n2.\n\n2.2  Organization and activities of the Board of \nDirectors\n\nFOUR SPECIAL-PURPOSE COMMITTEES ASSIST GROUP MANAGEMENT:\n\n⧁ The Group Review  \nBoard\n\n⧁ The Mergers & Acquisitions \nCommittee\n\n⧁ The Investment  \nCommittee\n\n⧁ The Risk  \nCommittee\n\nAttendance \n\n97%\nMembers  \n\n15\nIndependence 1 \n\n75%\nMeetings \n\n12 \n\nAttendance  \n\n100%\nMembers  \n\n6\nIndependence  \n\n40%\nMeetings \n\n5 \n\n2.2.1  Organization of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Board of Directors is a collegiate body that collectively represents \nall shareholders and is required to act in all circumstances in the \ninterests of the Company.

Given Capgemini’s business as a service provider, the \nBoard pays particular attention to the management of the Group \n270,000\xa0employees and thousands of managers across the globe.\n\nThe work of the Board of Directors and its Specialized committees in \n2020 in accordance with their duties is presented in detail in Sections \n2.2.2 and 2.2.4. Additional information on the diversity policy of \nthe Board and the management bodies is presented in Sections \n2.1.3 and 2.1.5, respectively. The internal control, risk management \nand Group compliance systems are detailed in Section\xa03.1.\n\nOperating rules – Corporate Governance framework\n\nCapgemini\xa0SE refers to the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance \nCode for listed companies (January\xa02020 version), in addition to \napplicable legislative and regulatory provisions.\n\nFor many years, the Capgemini\xa0SE Board of Directors has applied \nbest governance practices now aligned with the recommendations \nof the AFEP-MEDEF Code and strives constantly to improve its \ngovernance. Accordingly, the Board has:\n\n—  prepared, adopted, applied and amended where useful or \nnecessary the Board of Directors’ Charter, particularly as \npart of a constant drive to improve the governance of the \nCompany (see below); \n\n—  set up four specialized board committees – the Audit & \nRisk Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Ethics \n& Governance Committee, and finally the Strategy & CSR \nCommittee – and given each a clearly defined role (see \nSection\xa02.2.4); \n\n—  created the role of Lead Independent Director in May\xa02014, \nwith specific prerogatives and duties to contribute to the \nbalanced governance of Capgemini where the duties of \nChairman and Chief Executive Oficer are grouped together \nor where the Chairman of the Board is not an Independent \nDirector as defined by the AFEP-MEDEF Code (see 2.1.2\xa0above); \n\n— a dopted a system for allocating directors’ compensation, \nwhereby the majority of such compensation is indexed \nto attendance at Board and Committee meetings (see \nSection\xa02.3.1); \n\n\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE \nOrganization and activities of the Board of Directors\n\nCAPGEMINI 69\n\n2.\n\n—  periodically reviewed the personal situation of each director \nin light of the definition of independence adopted by the \nAFEP-MEDEF Code (“a director is independent when he/she \nhas no relationship of any sort with the Company, the Group \nor its Management, that is likely to impair his/her judgment”) \n(see Section\xa02.1.3); \n\n—  regularly assessed its organization and operation, either \nat the time of the annual internal assessment performed \nby the Lead Independent Director or three-yearly, through \nthe assessment conducted by an external consultant under \nthe responsibility of the Lead Independent Director (see \nSection\xa02.2.3); \n\n—  assessed since 2015 the effective contribution of each director \nto the activities of the Board of Directors, at the time of the \nannual Board assessment (see Section\xa02.2.3).\n\nCompliance with the AFEP‑MEDEF Code\n\nCapgemini\xa0SE is constantly seeking to improve its governance \nand regularly monitors its compliance with the provisions of the \nAFEP-MEDEF Code.\n\nUnder the “Comply or Explain” rule provided for in Article \nL. 22-10-10 of the French Commercial Code and stipulated in \nArticle 27.1 of the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code for \nlisted companies revised in January 2020, the Company considers \nthat its practices comply fully with the recommendations of the \nAFEP-MEDEF Code.\n\nIn this constant drive to improve the Company’s governance, the \nCompany has voluntarily brought the following issues, explained in \nprevious years by the Company, into compliance with the provisions \nof the AFEP-MEDEF Code:\n\n—  the Shareholders’ Meeting of May\xa0 18, 2016 amended the \nCompany’s bylaws to provide for the staggered renewal of \nthe terms of ofice of directors, in line with Article 14.2\xa0of the \nAFEP-MEDEF Code; \n\n—  in accordance with Article 22\xa0of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, the \nemployment contract of the Chairman and Chief Executive \nOficer was terminated on February\xa018, 2015; \n\n— i n light of the recommendations of the French Financial \nMarkets Authority (AMF) and the Corporate Governance \nhigh Committee, the Board of Directors implemented an \nappraisal procedure in 2015 to assess the absence of conflicts \nof interest for independent directors.\n\nBoard Charters\n\nThe Charters of the Board of Directors and the specialized board \ncommittees are available on the Company’s website: www.\ncapgemini.com.\n\nThe Board Charter defines the operation and organization of the \nBoard of Directors and supplements the prevailing provisions of the \nlaw and the bylaws. It is consistent with market recommendations \naimed at guaranteeing compliance with fundamental Corporate \nGovernance principles and particularly the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate \nGovernance Code for listed companies to which the Company adheres.\n\nWhen the legal form of the Company returned to that of a traditional \nlimited liability company (société anonyme) in May\xa02000, a new \nCharter was debated and adopted by the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Charter has since been amended several times in line with \nchanges in legal and regulatory provisions and changes specific \nto the Company and as part of the constant drive to improve \ngovernance, with the dual aim of facilitating the collective working \nof the Board of Directors and satisfying the Corporate Governance \nexpectations of shareholders and their representatives.\n\nIn 2020, the Board of Directors decided to amend the Board of \nDirectors’ Charter on the separation of the duties of Chairman of \nthe Board of Directors and Chief Executive Oficer. The amendments \nfocused mainly on the definition of the duties of the Chairman of \nthe Board of Directors and the allocation of roles between the \nChairman of the Board of Directors and the Lead Independent \nDirector, the Board of Directors having decided to retain the position \nof Lead Independent Director while the Chairman of the Board is \nnot an Independent Director as defined by the AFEP-MEDEF Code \nto which the Company adheres.\n\nOrganization of powers\n\nThe Capgemini\xa0SE Board of Directors’ Charter sets out or clarifies \nthe scope of and basis for exercising the various powers entrusted \nto the Board of Directors, the four specialized board committees, \nthe Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Vice-Chairman and \nthe Lead Independent Director.\n\nThe Board of Directors is a collegiate body that collectively represents \nall shareholders and is required to act in all circumstances in the \ninterests of the Company, by taking into consideration the social \nand environmental issues associated with its activities.\n\nThe role of the four specialized board committees is to study and \ndocument the issues that the Board has scheduled for discussion \nand to present recommendations on the subjects and sectors within \ntheir remit to plenary sessions of the Board. The Committees are \nconsultation bodies and therefore hold no decision-making powers. \nTheir members and the Chairman are appointed by the Board of \nDirectors and are selected exclusively from among Capgemini\xa0SE \ndirectors. They are appointed in a personal capacity and may under no \ncircumstances be represented at the meetings of the Committee(s) \nto which they belong. The Board reserves the right to amend at any \ntime the number and/or make-up of these Committees, as well as \nthe scope of their duties. Finally, the Charters of each of the four \nCommittees – and any amendments thereto which the Committees \nmay later propose – must be formally approved by the Board.\n\nThe Chairman of the Board of Directors prepares, organizes and \nleads its work. he sets the agenda of meetings, communicates to \ndirectors all information necessary to carry out their duties and \noversees the proper operation of the Company’s bodies, the correct \nimplementation of Board decisions and compliance with the rules \nof good conduct adopted by Capgemini. he chairs Shareholders’ \nMeetings to which he reports on the organization, activities and \ndecisions of the Board (see Section\xa02.1.2 for a detailed description \nof the role and duties of the Chairman of the Board of Directors \nand particularly the specific duties entrusted to the Chairman of \nthe Board of Directors during the management hand-over phase \nterminating at the end of the 2022 Shareholders’ Meeting).\n\nIn the absence of the Chairman, the Vice‑Chairman chairs meetings \nof the Board of Directors and Shareholders’ Meetings. The Board \nof Directors decided to entrust him with a specific assignment \nto prepare future changes in the Group’s governance during the \nperiod 2017-2019. he was therefore closely involved in discussions \non changes in the Group’s governance, the appointment of two \nChief Operating Oficers and monitoring management transition, \nup to the announcement of the choice for future Chief Executive \nOficer to succeed Mr. Paul hermelin in May\xa02020. This specific \nassignment ended on May\xa020, 2020.\n\nA Lead Independent Director is appointed from among independent \ndirectors where the duties of Chairman of the Board of Directors \nand Chief Executive Oficer are grouped together or, if they are \nseparated, where the Chairman of the Board of Directors is not \nan Independent Director as defined by the AFEP-MEDEF Code.\n\n\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE \nOrganization and activities of the Board of Directors\n\n70 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n2.\n\nThe duties and composition of the specialized board committees are \npresented in Section\xa02.2.4. The role and prerogatives of the Lead \nIndependent Director are set‑out in Section\xa02.1.2.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer has the most extensive powers to act \nin all circumstances in the name of the Company, subject to the \nrestrictions presented in Section\xa02.1.2. he may be assisted in his \nduties by one or more Chief Operating Officers.\n\nDirector ethics\n\nThe Board of Directors’ Charter sets out the main obligations of \nthe Code of Business Ethics that Capgemini\xa0SE directors undertake \nto comply with throughout their term of ofice.\n\nAn extract from the Code of Business Ethics is included in the \nCharter of the Board of Directors and detailed below:\n\n“The Directors (and any other person who attends Board or \nCommittee meetings) are required to treat as strictly confidential \nmatters discussed during Board or Committee meetings and all \nBoard or Committee decisions, as well as any information of a \nconfidential nature or that is presented as such by the Chairman \nand Chief Executive Oficer or Chairman (as applicable) or any other \nDirector. Each Director undertakes to comply with the following \nobligations, unless he/she has informed the Chairman and Chief \nExecutive Oficer or Chairman (as applicable), in writing, of any \nobjections to one or several of such obligations:\n\n1.  Although they are themselves shareholders, the Directors \nrepresent all the shareholders and are required to act \nin all circumstances in the Company’s interest. They are \nrequired to notify the Chairman of the Ethics & Governance \nCommittee or the Board of any one-off conflict of interests or \npotential conflict of interests and to refrain from attending \ndeliberations and voting on the related decision. Any director \nwho has a permanent conflict of interest is required to resign \nfrom the Board. Board members must inform the Chairman \nof the Ethics and Governance Committee of business dealings \nbetween the Company and the companies or entities with \nwhich they are linked, as well as any offers of appointments \nthey receive (see 3\xa0 below) in order to ensure that they are \ncompatible with their appointment and the functions they \ncarry out within the Company.\n\n2.  Each Director undertakes to hold (or to purchase within \nsix months of his/her election) at least 1,000\xa0 shares of the \nCompany. The shares acquired to fulfill this obligation \nmust be held in registered form. This obligation does not \napply to directors representing employees and employee \nshareholders.\n\n3.  The Directors are required to devote the necessary time and \nattention to their duties. The Directors may not hold more \nthan four other appointments in French or non-French listed \ncompanies that are not members of the Capgemini group \nand must comply with all applicable regulations restricting \nthe number of directorships held by a single person. The \nChief Executive Oficer and any Chief Operating Oficers \nmay not hold more than two other directorships in French \nor non-French listed companies that are not members of \nthe Capgemini group; they must request the opinion of the \nBoard before accepting any new appointment in a listed \ncompany. If the Chairman is not also the Chief Executive \nOficer, the Board may issue specific recommendations, \ngiven his/her status and specific assignments. During \nthe term of their ofice at the Company, Directors must \n\nkeep the Chairman of the Board informed of any offers of \nappointments they would like to accept in other French or \nnon-French companies, and their membership of Board \ncommittees of these companies, as well as any change in \ntheir appointments or participation in these committees.  \nIf the functions of Chairman and Chief Executive Oficer are \ncombined, he/she will inform the Chairman of the Ethics & \nGovernance Committee. The Chairman informs the Board of \nDirectors of appointments accepted.\n\n4.  The members of the Board of Directors must attend all \nmeetings of the Board and all meetings of the Committees \nof which they are members, as well as all Shareholders’ \nMeetings. In its annual Universal Registration Document, the \nCompany publishes Directors’ individual attendance rates at \nmeetings of the Board and the Committees of which they are \nmembers, as well as average attendance rates.\n\n5.  The Directors are obliged to keep abreast of the Company’s \nsituation and development. To this end, they may ask the \nChairman to communicate on a timely basis all information \nthat is essential to allow them to contribute effectively to \nthe discussion of matters included on the agenda of the next \nBoard meeting. Regarding information not available to the \npublic that is obtained in their capacity, Directors are subject \nto secrecy rules extending beyond the simple requirement of \ndiscretion imposed by law.\n\n6.  In accordance with laws and regulations applicable to insider \ntrading, as set more specifically by the French Monetary and \nFinancial Code and the general regulations of the French \nFinancial Markets Authority (AMF), the members of the \nBoard of Directors shall refrain from:\n\n— c arrying out any transactions on the securities (including \nderivatives) of companies about which (and in the extent \nto which) they have privileged information by virtue of \ntheir position as a member of the Board of Directors of the \nCompany,\n\n—  carrying out any transactions, whether direct, indirect or \nthrough derivatives, involving the securities of the Company:\n\n–  during a period commencing on the thirtieth calendar \nday preceding the public release of mid-year and full-year \nresults and ending after the close of the trading day of \nthe said public release,\n\n– a nd during a period commencing on the fifteenth calendar \nday preceding quarterly announcements and ending \nafter the close of the trading day of the said public \nrelease.\n\n7.  In conformity with the Monetary and Financial Code and \nwith the general regulations of the French Financial Markets \nAuthority (AMF) each Director is required to notify the AMF \nand the Company by electronic means of all transactions \ncarried out involving Capgemini\xa0 SE securities within three \nbusiness days following their execution.“\n\n \n\nThe Board seeks to comply with and ensure compliance with all \nrules of good governance together with a certain number of values \nwhich each Board member has solemnly undertaken to respect.  \nA “Code of Business Ethics” was drafted at its initiative and distributed \nto all Group employees (and is signed by all new recruits) with the \nfollowing main objectives:\n\n—  ensure all Group companies comply with a certain number \nof rules of good behavior and primarily that of perfect \nintegrity in the conduct of business and the management of \nemployees; \n\n\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE \nOrganization and activities of the Board of Directors\n\nCAPGEMINI 71\n\n2.\n\n—  implement measures stopping, fighting and sanctioning \nnon-compliance with the core values of the Group, or prevailing \nlaws and regulations in the relevant country; \n\n—  provide an institutional framework for the actions, controls \nand dissuasive measures required to deal with the problems \nidentified by these measures.\n\nThe report on the work of the Ethics & Governance Committee (see \nSection\xa02.2.4\xa0below) describes in detail the actions undertaken in 2020 \nby the Ethics & Compliance Department and the implementation of \nthe Code of Business Ethics. On its update at the beginning of 2019, \neach director signed the new Code, evidencing their commitment \nand support (both individual and collective) for all the measures \ncontained therein. Implementation by the Group of its Ethics & \nCompliance program is detailed in Section\xa04.2.\n\nDirector training\n\nThe Board of Directors is briefed on changes in markets, the \ncompetitive environment and the main challenges facing the \nCompany, including with respect to Corporate Social Responsibility.\n\nIntegration of new directors\n\nCapgemini ensures that directors joining the Board receive training \nin the specific aspects of the Group, its businesses and activity \nsectors, particularly through meetings with the various members of \nGroup Management. New directors are also advised on the specific \naspects of the Company’s Board of Directors during meetings with \nthe Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Oficer, \nthe Lead Independent Director, the Committee Chairmen and the \n\nBoard Secretary. In addition, the new members joining the Audit \n& Risk Committee receive information on the specific accounting, \nfinancial and operating aspects of the Company.\n\nOngoing training\n\nCapgemini ensures that the directors have suficient understanding \nof the Group, its ecosystem and its challenges. The Board members \ntherefore meet regularly with the members of the Group Executive \nBoard during Board and Committee meetings. The directors are \nalso invited to the Group “Rencontres” gatherings, a recurring event \nbringing together, over three days, around 500\xa0of the Group’s key \nmanagers and emerging talent. In addition, each year a Board \nmeeting dedicated to strategy is held in the form of a seminar \nand invites key managers of the Group to contribute to Board \ndiscussions. These seminars also enable directors to constantly \nrefine their understanding of the challenges facing the Group \nthrough themed-based presentations and site visits.\n\nFurthermore, the Board organizes a range of specific training \nsessions throughout the year to help directors increase their \nknowledge of the Group (through presentations of its ecosystem, \nchallenges, businesses and certain of its regions) and its competitive \nenvironment, as well as recent market disruption trends and \ntechnological developments; \n\nFurthermore, the directors representing employees regularly \nreceive special external training, enabling them to obtain and \nperfect the knowledge and techniques necessary to the exercise \nof their duties, in accordance with legislative provisions.\n\n2.2.2  Activities of the Board of Directors in 2020\n\nBoard of Directors’ meetings\n\nNumber of meetings and attendance rate\n\nThe Board meets at least six times a year. Meetings are convened \nby the Chairman in accordance with a schedule decided by the \nBoard well in advance. This schedule may be amended during the \nyear in response to unforeseen circumstances or at the request \nof more than one director.\n\nIn 2020, the Board met 12 times during the year (including by \nvideo-conference and conference call), seven times during the \nfirst-half and five times during the second-half. The high number \nof Board meetings was due to the organization of exceptional \nmeetings, either due to the tender offer launched for Altran \nTechnologies or to monitor the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic \nand the implementation of a range of solidarity measures with \ndifferent Group stakeholders.\n\nManaging the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic, first and foremost \nwith regards to employees but also as concerns clients and other \nGroup stakeholders, was closely monitored by the Board of \nDirectors in 2020, at each of the meetings from the start of the \nhealth crisis in March\xa02020.\n\nThe Board of Directors also made use of emergency health measures \nenabling decisions to be taken by written consultation to change \nthe location of the Shareholders’ Meeting held behind closed doors.\n\nThe Board meeting focusing primarily on the Group’s strategy was \nheld on June\xa010 and 11, 2020 in the form of a seminar.\n\nIn addition, the Board held three executive sessions chaired by \nthe Lead Independent Director and without the presence of the \nChairman and Chief Executive Oficer and then the Chairman of \nthe Board and the Chief Executive Oficer. These sessions mainly \ndiscussed the compensation of the Chairman and Chief Executive \nOficer and the compensation of the Chairman of the Board and \nthe Chief Executive Oficer following the adoption of a separated \ngovernance structure.\n\nThe average attendance rate at Board meetings was 97%, despite \nthe increase in the number of meetings. This demonstrates the \ninvolvement and availability of the directors throughout the year \nfor issues of particular importance to the Group.

This platform is hosted on a server located in France. \nIn 2015, this platform, which is used for Board of Directors’ and \nCommittee meetings, was reviewed and modernized in response to \nwishes expressed by directors, to make it more mobile, accessible \nfrom any location and even more secure.\n\nActivities of the Board in 2020\n\nThe agenda of Board of Directors’ meetings is defined not only to \nprovide directors with an overview of the Group’s position, but also \nwith regard to Group governance principles, which, pursuant to \nprevailing texts and to the Board of Directors’ Charter, presuppose \nthat Board members will make decisions on specific topics.\n\n\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE \nOrganization and activities of the Board of Directors\n\nCAPGEMINI 73\n\n2.\n\nGroup strategy and  \n organization, CSR Governance Management transition\n\n—  Implementation of strategic \npriorities\n\n—  External growth opportunities, \nincluding monitoring the acquisition \nand integration of Altran\n\n—  Review of the main changes in \nmarkets and the competitive \nenvironment\n\n—  Intelligent Industry, Cloud and  \ndata strategy\n\n—  Monitoring of strategic partnerships\n—  Monitoring of the CSR strategy\n\n—  Changes in the composition of  \nthe Board and its Committees\n\n—  Preparation of the Shareholders’ \nMeeting\n\n—  Internal assessment of the Board\n—  Participation in work on the Purpose\n—  Monitoring of dialogue with \n\nshareholders and proxy advisors\n\n—  Implementation of a governance \nstructure separating the duties of \nChairman of the Board and Chief \nExecutive Oficer\n\n—  Definition of the duties of Chairman \nof the Board and allocation of roles \nbetween the Chairman of the Board \nand the Lead Independent Director\n\nGroup Performance Audit & Risk\nTalent management and \ncompensation\n\n—  Management of the impact of  \nthe Covid-19 pandemic and \nsolidarity measures\n\n—  Group performance and activities\n—  Active management of the Group \n\nbalance sheet and liquidity \n(including Altran acquisition \nrefinancing transactions)\n\n—  2019 Company financial statements\n—  2019 consolidated financial \n\nstatements and 2020 first-half \ninterim consolidated financial \nstatements\n\n—  Renewal of the Statutory auditors\n—  Risk monitoring\n—  Internal control and Internal audit\n—  Monitoring of the Group’s various \n\nethics and compliance actions\n\n \n\n—  Monitoring of Group talent \nmanagement and the management \nteam succession process\n\n—  Diversity policy for management \nbodies\n\n—  Compensation of Executive \nCorporate Oficers\n\n—  Performance share and free share \ngrants\n\n—  New employee share ownership plan\n\nAccordingly, in addition to approving the 2019 annual financial \nstatements and the financial statements for the first-half of 2020 \nand convening the Shareholders’ Meeting of May\xa020, 2020, the \nactivities of the Board of Directors focused on:\n\n1.

The results of this assessment \nare presented below.\n\nFurthermore, in accordance with the three-year frequency \nrecommended by the AFEP-MEDEF Code, a formal assessment \nof the activities of the Board of Directors and its Specialized \ncommittees was performed at the end of 2019 with the assistance \nof an external service provider. The conclusions of this assessment \nled to the implementation of specific action plans in 2020.\n\n2019 external assessment: conclusions and actions \nimplemented in 2020\n\nIn accordance with the three-year frequency recommended by \nthe AFEP-MEDEF Code, a formal assessment of the activities of \nthe Board of Directors and its Specialized committees in 2019 was \nconducted by an external service provider under the responsibility \nof the Lead Independent Director and was presented in detail in \nthe 2019 Universal Registration Document.\n\nAfter this assessment, the following measures were implemented \nin 2020 for the four priorities approved by the Board of Directors:\n\n —  Management transition as part of the Group Management \nsuccession plan\n\nMonitoring the management transition process implemented since \n2017 remained a key priority of the Board of Directors and the Ethics \n& Governance Committee in 2020. A separated governance structure \nwas implemented on May\xa020, 2020, leading to the appointment \nof Mr. Aiman Ezzat as Chief Executive Oficer to succeed Mr. Paul \nhermelin. The Board of Directors also confirmed Mr. Paul hermelin \nas Chairman of the Board of Directors. It wished the Company \nto continue to benefit from Mr. Paul hermelin’s expertise and \nexperience and his in-depth knowledge of the Group, thereby \nensuring a smooth management hand-over. The Board of Directors \nalso decided to extend the duties entrusted to the Chairman of \nthe Board of Directors during a management hand-over phase \nnot exceeding two years and terminating at the end of the 2022 \nShareholders’ Meeting. In addition, the Board of Directors also \ndecided to retain the position of Lead Independent Director for \nas long as the duties of Chairman of the Board are assumed by a \ndirector who is not independent as defined by the AFEP-MEDEF \nCode to which the Company adheres.\n\n —  Composition of the Board of Directors\n\nAs part of the Board’s work on changes in its composition and \nin accordance with the objectives set for the period 2018-2022 \n(international diversification, diversification of profiles, staggered \nrenewal of terms of ofice, maintenance of a measured number of \ndirectors enabling coherence and collective decision-making), the \nBoard of Directors proposed, in addition to the appointment of \nMr. Aiman Ezzat, the appointment of Ms.\xa0Belen Moscoso del Prado \nand the renewal of the term of ofice of Ms.\xa0Siân herbert-Jones at \nthe Shareholders’ Meeting of May\xa020, 2020. Ms.\xa0Laura Desmond \ndid not seek the renewal of her term of ofice.\n\nThese appointments enabled the Board of Directors to further \nthe international diversification of its composition, deepen its \nindustry expertise and enrich the diversity of its profiles, while \nmaintaining a measured number of directors and high level of \nindependence within the Board.\n\n —  Talent management and Executive Management \nsuccession plans\n\nThe Ethics & Governance Committee, followed by the Board of \nDirectors, reviewed the new procedures implemented by Group \n\nManagement to manage succession plans for Executive Management \n(Group Executive Board and the Executive Committee) to ensure \ntalent able to assume the highest operational and functional \nresponsibilities in the Group has been identified, while remaining \nopen to the addition of new talent.\n\n —  Corporate, Social and Environmental Responsibility (CSR)\n\nThe Strategy & CSR Committee discussed new performance indicators \nfor the Group’s CSR strategy and issued recommendations. The \nimplementation of the Group’s CSR strategy was also presented \nto both the Strategy & CSR Committee and the Board of Directors. \nThroughout 2020, the Board of Directors ensured it took account \nof the social and environmental implications of its decisions, \nparticularly when monitoring the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic \nand the implementation of a range of solidarity measures with \ndifferent Group stakeholders.\n\n2020 Assessment: conclusions and priorities for 2021\n\nIn 2020, the Lead Independent Director led an internal assessment \nbased on a questionnaire sent to all directors at the end of 2020. \nThis questionnaire covered both the composition and activities of \nthe Board of Directors and the activities of the specialized board \ncommittees on which they sit. In addition, it offered the opportunity \nto take stock of actions implemented in 2020 following the 2019 \nexternal assessment.\n\nThe Lead Independent Director met individually with each member \nof the Board of Directors to discuss the comments raised in the \nquestionnaire and the effective contribution of each director to \nthe Board’s activities.\n\nThe results of this assessment were presented to and discussed \nwith the Ethics & Governance Committee on February\xa09, 2021 \nbefore being presented to the Board of Directors’ meeting of \nFebruary\xa017, 2021.\n\nThe directors expressed their general satisfaction with the activities \nand organization of the Board and its Committees.\n\nThey highlighted, in particular, the success of the management \ntransition process launched in 2017, which led to the separation of \nthe duties of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive \nOficer on May\xa020, 2020 and the key role played by the Board of \nDirectors in this process, with the full support of Mr. Paul hermelin.\n\nThe Board members welcomed the regular reports presented on the \nmanagement of the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic, with respect \nto employees but also customers and other Group stakeholders, as \nwell as the Group’s responsiveness in this unprecedented context.\n\nThe directors also reiterated their interest in organizing training \nsessions outside the Board meetings and meetings with Group \nmanagers, as well as the quality of the new director integration \nprogram.\n\nCertain areas for improvement were also identified concerning \nthe composition and activities of the Board. The international \ndiversification of the Board must, in particular, remain a priority \nat the next Shareholders’ Meeting. Directors also expressed \ntheir desire to spend less time on presentations at meetings to \nmake them more interactive and focused on debate, and that \nmore executive sessions be organized in addition to those held \nto discuss compensation.\n\nFollowing this assessment, the Board of Directors set the following \npriorities for 2021:\n\n —  Strategy\n\nMonitoring of the integration of Altran.\n\n\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE \nOrganization and activities of the Board of Directors\n\n76 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n2.\n\nContinued dialogue between the Chief Executive Oficer and the \nBoard to validate the Group’s new strategic direction beyond this \ndetermining acquisition.\n\n —  Composition of the Board of Directors\n\nContinuation of the 2018-2022 objectives set by the Board of Directors \n(international diversification, diversification of profiles, staggered \nrenewal of terms of ofice, maintenance of a measured number \n\nof directors enabling coherence and collective decision-making), \nwith a focus on international diversification.\n\n —  Activities of the Board of Directors\n\nOrganization of executive sessions on a range of governance issues.\n\nChanges to the structure of Board meetings to make them more \ninteractive.\n\n2.2.4  Role and composition of the four specialized board committees\n\nThe Audit & Risk Committee\n\n95%\nAttendance\n\n100%\nIndependence\n\n9\nMeetingsMembers\n\n4\n\nN.B. All figures are up to date at December\xa031, 2020.\n\nCommittee duties\n\nThe duties of the Audit Committee were changed on December\xa07, \n2016 to strengthen the monitoring of risk management and include \nthe impacts of the European statutory audit reform. The Committee \nname was also changed to the Audit & Risk Committee.\n\nThese changes in the Committee’s duties followed concerns \nexpressed by directors to improve risk monitoring by associating \nthe Board of Directors and the Audit Committee.\n\nIn accordance with Article L.\xa0823-19\xa0of the French Commercial Code, \nthe French Financial Markets Authority (AMF) recommendation of \nJuly\xa022, 2010 and best market practice, the duties of the Audit & \nRisk Committee fall into three categories.\n\nFirstly, the Audit & Risk Committee monitors issues concerning the \npreparation and control of financial and accounting information. It \nmonitors the financial information preparation process and, where \napplicable, suggests recommendations to guarantee its integrity. \nIt examines the draft annual and half-year consolidated financial \nstatements of the Group, the annual accounts of Capgemini\xa0SE \nand the management presentation of risk exposure and material \noff-balance sheet commitments of the Company, as well as the \naccounting options adopted.\n\nFollowing the amendment of its Charter in March\xa02019, it ensures that \nthere is a rigorous process for preparing the Group’s non-financial \ninformation and reviews the draft statement on non-financial \nperformance.\n\nSecondly, the Audit & Risk Committee ensures the existence \nand eficiency of internal control systems, internal audit and the \nmanagement of major risks to which the Group is exposed in the \ncourse of its business (such as financial, legal, operating, employee \nand environmental risks and the resulting measures implemented). \nFollowing the strengthening of these risk monitoring duties, the \nCommittee must notably review the major risks to which the Group \nmay be exposed at least once annually, in particular through a \nreview of the risk mapping prepared and updated by the Group \nManagement Risk Committee.\n\nFinally, the Committee is responsible for monitoring the statutory \naudit of the annual and half-year consolidated financial statements \nof the Group and the annual accounts of the Company, ensuring the \nindependence of the Statutory auditors and generally monitoring \nthe conduct of their engagements.\n\nWhere it considers it useful or necessary, the Audit & Risk Committee \nmay be assisted by experts appointed for this purpose.\n\nComposition and participation\n\nSince May\xa020, 2020, the Committee has four directors, all of whom \nare independent:\n\nMr. Xavier Musca (Chairman and Independent Director), Ms. Xiaoqun \nClever (Independent Director), Ms. Laurence Dors (Independent \nDirector) and Ms. Siân Herbert-Jones (Independent Director).\n\nThrough their professional careers, Audit & Risk Committee members \nhave amassed the necessary accounting and financial expertise \nto perform their duties. Mr. Xavier Musca acquired considerable \nexpertise in the French and international financial and banking \nsectors throughout his career in the French civil service, ministerial \nofices and the private sector. Ms.\xa0Xiaoqun Clever has held Executive \nManagement positions in international groups and therefore brings \nfinancial expertise and a business perspective particularly useful for \nrisk monitoring activities. Ms.\xa0Siân herbert-Jones was Chief Financial \nOficer of Sodexo from 2001 to 2016. Finally, Ms.\xa0Laurence Dors’ \ncareer in Executive Management positions and the Economy and \nFinance Ministry allows her to contribute both financial expertise \nand a transversal view of organizations.\n\nThe Committee met nine times in 2020, with an average attendance \nrate of 95%.\n\nThe individual attendance rate of each member of the Audit & Risk \nCommittee in 2020 was as follows:\n\nXavier MUSCA (Chairman) 89%\n\nAnne BOUVEROT* 100%\n\nXiaoqun CLEVER 100%\n\nLaurence DORS 100%\n\nSiân hERBERT-JONES 89%\n\n* Ms.\xa0Anne Bouverot stepped down on May\xa020, 2020. She therefore attended all \nof the meetings held during the relevant period.\n\nCommittee activities in 2020\n\nThe Committee reviewed the annual accounts of Capgemini\xa0SE and \nthe consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year \nended December\xa031, 2019, the condensed interim consolidated \nfinancial statements for the half-year ended June\xa030, 2020 and \nthe 2020 budget.\n\nIt focused particularly on the accounting treatment of the acquisition \nof the Altran group in March\xa02020, the communication of estimated \nhalf-year results at the end of July\xa02020 and monitoring of goodwill \nvalues in the context of the health crisis.\n\nThe Committee reviewed changes in the tax expense, deferred tax \nassets and the provision for pensions and other post-employment \nbenefits, as well as the analysis of other operating income and \nexpenses. The Committee also reviewed the information systems \nthat contribute to accounting and financial information.\n\n\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE \nOrganization and activities of the Board of Directors\n\nCAPGEMINI 77\n\n2.\n\nThe Statutory auditors reported to the Committee on the quality \nof the accounting monitoring of projects and the good control of \nthe accounts closing process.\n\nAs part of its risk management oversight activities, the Committee \ntook due note of the risk mapping updated at the end of 2020 based \non interviews conducted with around thirty Group managers as \nwell as employees treating specific risk issues. This work resulted \nin the identification of fourteen critical risks for which action plans \nare drawn up, monitored by the risk owners and reviewed twice \na year by the Group Management Risk Committee. The owners \nof certain critical risks (major contractual commitments in client \ncontracts and personal data protection) presented a report on the \nmanagement of these risks to the Committee.\n\nThe Audit & Risk Committee also interviewed:\n\n—  the Internal Audit Director, questioning him on working \nmethods, planning, areas of intervention, resources, the \nconclusions of audits carried out during the year and the \nfollow-up of recommendations; \n\n—  the Delivery Director (Production/Methods and Support), \nquestioning him in particular on the impact on the operating \naccounts of major contracts that are separately monitored; \n\n—  the Group Cybersecurity Oficer, questioning him on the \noversight and management of cyber risks, notably with respect \nto implementation of working from home in the context \nof the Covid-19 pandemic, but also with regards to recent \nchanges in cyber risks; \n\n—  the Director in charge of pre-sales risk management, questioning \nhim on the activities of the Group Review Board during the \nperiod and the terms and conditions of major commercial \nproposals.\n\nThe Committee reviewed the draft statement on non-financial \nperformance.\n\nThe Committee also monitored the Group statutory auditor \nselection process for the 6-year period from 2020 to 2025 and \nissued a recommendation to the Board of Directors in preparation \nof the Shareholders’ Meeting of May\xa020, 2020.\n\nThe Committee met with the Statutory auditors during a meeting \nfocusing on the audit approach, key audit matters, the audit scope, \nits planning and the internal control review.\n\nFinally, the Committee took note of the non-audit services approved \nduring the fiscal year and finalized its work program for 2021.\n\nThe Compensation Committee\n\n96%\nAttendance\n\n100%(1)\nIndependence\n\n5\nMeetingsMembers\n\n5\n\nN.B.

The Committee has several duties set out in its Charter.\n\nFirstly, it must present proposals to the Board of Directors on the \nfixed and variable compensation of Executive Corporate Oficers \nand, with regards to the variable portion and where appropriate, \npropose a detailed list of individual objectives (quantitative and \nqualitative), enabling an assessment of performance and the \ncalculation of the variable compensation component (s). The \nCommittee reviews the information presented to shareholders for \nthe vote on Executive Corporate Oficer compensation (so-called \n“Say on Pay”) and is consulted on financial terms and conditions in the \nevent of the appointment or departure of an Executive Corporate \nOficer. It also reviews the information presented to shareholders \nfor the vote on director compensation and proposes allocations \nrules and a total compensation amount to the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Compensation Committee must be informed of the compensation \npolicies adopted by Capgemini group companies in the management \nof senior executive careers and the application of these policies \nwith respect to the Group’s medium and long-term strategy \npresented to the Board of Directors. The Committee must also be \ninformed annually by Group Management of the (fixed and variable) \ncompensation of Executive Committee members.\n\nFollowing the amendment of its Charter in March\xa02019, the Committee \nensures that Group Management implements a diversity policy \nand objectives for management bodies. To this end, the work of \nthe Strategy & CSR Committee is invaluable.\n\nFinally, the Committee reviews the various schemes enabling \nsenior executives to better share in the Group’s profits (long-term \nincentive instruments and particularly performance share grants, \nGroup savings schemes,\xa0etc.) and proposes to the Board of Directors \nthe incentive instruments it considers appropriate and capable of \nbeing implemented in all (or certain) Capgemini group companies.\n\nComposition and participation\n\nThe Committee has five directors since May\xa020, 2020:\n\nMs. Laurence Dors (Chairman and Independent Director),  \nMr. Pierre Pringuet (Independent Director), Mr. Kevin Masters \n(Director representing employees), Ms. Belen Moscoso del Prado \n(Independent Director) and Ms. Lucia Sinapi-Thomas (Director \nrepresenting employee shareholders).\n\nThis Committee met five times in 2020, with an average attendance \nrate of 96%.\n\nThe individual attendance rate of each member of the Compensation \nCommittee in 2020 was as follows:\n\nLaurence DORS (Chairman) 100%\n\nKevin MASTERS 100%\n\nBelen MOSCOSO DEL PRADO* 100%\n\nPierre PRINGUET 80%\n\nLucia SINAPI-ThOMAS 100%\n\n* Ms.\xa0 Belen Moscoso del Prado joined the Compensation Committee following \nher appointment by the Shareholders’ Meeting of May\xa020, 2020.\n\nCommittee activities in 2020\n\nIn accordance with the Committee’s remit, it ensured throughout \n2020 the consistency of the Group’s senior executive compensation \npolicy.

This continued throughout \n2020, with initially the search for commercial synergies and then \nthe development of an integrated model to be rolled-out from \nJanuary\xa01, 2021.\n\nThe Committee also helped prepare the Board of Directors’ \nstrategy seminar in June\xa02020, which largely focused on the \nGroup’s Intelligent Industry ambitions made possible by combining \nCapgemini’s and Altran’s expertise. This issue was also a major \ntopic during the Rencontres gatherings organized in September, in \npreparation of which the Committee was also presented the new \nCorporate Strategic Framework.\n\nThe Committee reviewed other external growth opportunities \nproposed by Group Management and its Strategy Department: \nto enhance Invent’s activities with Purpose, one of the world’s \nleading social impact agencies, to enable the diversification of its \nportfolio with Advectas, a Scandinavian leader in Data and Business \nIntelligence and to expand the Group’s presence in Australia with \nthe acquisition of WhiteSkyLabs, a leader in Mulesoft solutions and \nof RXP Services, a digital, data and cloud services consulting firm. \nOne of the key issues during the year was to define the rationale \nbehind and the means of selling Odigo, a Saas business created \nfrom Prosodie, to Apax Partners.\n\nThe Committee also reviewed the Group’s strategic partnerships \nand the offer portfolio.\n\nDuring this singular year when the activities of many clients were \nimpacted by Covid-19, the Committee also considered the impact \nof Covid-19 on the Group and how to support activities in the most \nheavily affected sectors.\n\nTrue to its interest in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) issues, \nthe Committee also debated the new performance indicators \nand issued recommendations. The three pillars of the Group’s \nCSR strategy remain people and inclusion, digital inclusion and \nenvironmental sustainability. Following the new Chief Executive \nOficer’s commitment to neutralize the Group’s carbon footprint by \n2025, this new CSR strategy will notably enable related objectives \nto be defined for Executive Committee members and the Chief \nExecutive Oficer for 2021.\n\n\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE \nCompensation of corporate officers\n\nCAPGEMINI 81\n\n2.\n\n2.3  Compensation of corporate officers\n\n2.3.1 Directors’ compensation  \n\n2.3.1.1  Directors’ compensation policy\n\nTotal compensation cap\n\nIn compensation for their participation in Board and Committee \nmeetings, the Company was authorized by the Shareholders’ \nMeeting of May\xa018, 2016 to pay total compensation to directors \nof up to €1,200,000\xa0per year.\n\nThe authorization given by the Shareholders’ Meeting of May\xa018, 2016 \nto increase the total maximum amount of directors’ compensation \nenabled the strategic objectives set by the Board of Directors to \nbe attained. This increase in the total amount allowed the Board \nto continue the renewal of its composition, welcoming four new \ndirectors in 2016, including two directors representing employees. \nIt was also able to focus the increase both on directors not \nresiding in France and on those heavily involved in the work of the \ncommittees (as Chairmen or members of several committees), while \nretaining the international outlook of the Board consistent with \nthe international development and global presence of the Group.\n\nAllocation rules\n\nThe method of allocating compensation to directors was reviewed \nin 2014, following the external assessment of the Board of Directors \nperformed in 2013. This review sought to take better account of the \nincreasing workload of committee Chairmen and encourage good \nattendance at meetings as well as of the travel time of directors \nresident outside France. Accordingly, directors’ compensation is \nnow allocated on the following basis:\n\n—  payment of a fixed annual amount to each director (currently \n€15,000); \n\n—  payment of a fixed amount for each attendance at an oficial \nmeeting of the Board (currently €4,000); \n\n—  the compensation for sitting on the specialized board \ncommittees was set with regard to the specific role of each \ncommittee and the ongoing work required of Chairmen, who \nnow solely receive a fixed annual payment as follows:\n\n– € 45,000 for the Lead Independent Director and Chairman \nof the Ethics & Governance Committee and €45,000 for \nthe Vice-Chairman of the Board of Directors,\n\n–  €35,000 for the Chairman of the Audit & Risk Committee,\n–  €25,000 for the Chairmen of the Compensation \n\nCommittee and the Strategy & CSR Committee; \n\n—  payment of a fixed amount for each attendance at a meeting \nof one of the four specialized board committees, excluding \nthe Committee Chairmen (currently €2,500); \n\n— p ayment of additional compensation per Board or \nCommittee meeting to take account of the travel time of \ndirectors resident outside Europe (currently €5,000) and \ndirectors resident outside France but in Europe (currently \n€2,000). This additional compensation is not allocated to \ndirectors representing employees, whose travel costs are \ncovered otherwise; \n\n—  compensation amount is calculated in two parts, at the end \nof the first six months and at the end of the year and is paid \nin two installments; \n\n—  under the compensation scale for a given fiscal year, if \ncircumstances require the Company to hold a greater than \nscheduled number of meetings, resulting in the maximum \namount authorized by the Shareholders’ Meeting being \nexceeded, these fixed amounts would be reduced in order \nto comply with the maximum amount authorized by the \nShareholders’ Meeting.\n\n2.3.1.2  Directors’ compensation in respect of 2020\n\nIn application of the above principles, total compensation of \n€1,164,000\xa0is due to directors in respect of 2020, representing 97% \nof the maximum amount authorized by the Combined Shareholders’ \nMeeting. After deduction of French and foreign withholding tax, \na net amount of €856,315\xa0was paid in respect of 2020.\n\nIt is recalled that Mr. Paul hermelin voluntarily waived his right to \ncollect the compensation that should have been paid to him as a \ndirector of Capgemini\xa0SE in respect of 2020 (as he has done for \nthe past ten years) and that Mr. Aiman Ezzat has also waived his \nright to collect compensation as a director of Capgemini\xa0SE since \nhis appointment to the Board of Directors.\n\n\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE \nCompensation of corporate officers\n\n82 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n2.\n\nCompensation due in respect of one fiscal year and paid during another fiscal year is detailed below:\n\n(in euros) \nAmount granted  \n\nin respect of 2020\nAmount granted  \n\nin respect of 2019\nGross amount  \n\npaid in 2020\nGross amount  \n\npaid in 2019\n\nDaniel Bernard 138,000 137,500 148,000 129,500\n\nAnne Bouverot 75,000 71,000 84,000 60,500\n\nXiaoqun Clever** 85,500 68,000 94,500 17,000\n\nLaura Desmond** 23,250 78,500 60,750 41,000\n\nLaurence Dors 123,000 112,500 120,500 104,500\n\nAiman Ezzat (waiver) n/a (waiver) n/a\n\nRobert Fretel* 31,250 65,000 63,750 59,500\n\nSiân herbert-Jones 83,000 75,000 80,500 67,000\n\nPaul hermelin (waiver) (waiver) (waiver) (waiver)\n\nhervé Jeannin* 45,500 n/a 13,000 n/a\n\nKevin Masters** 75,500 70,000 80,500 59,500\n\nBelen Moscoso del Prado 41,500 n/a 9,000 n/a\n\nXavier Muscat 98,000 90,000 98,000 82,000\n\nFrédéric Oudéa 75,500 67,500 78,000 59,500\n\nPatrick Pouyanné 75,500 63,500 71,500 62,000\n\nPierre Pringuet 118,000 115,000 123,000 104,500\n\nLucia Sinapi-Thomas 75,500 70,000 80,500 59,500\n\nTOTAL 1,164,000 1,083,500 1,205,500 906,000\n\n* Compensation of these beneficiaries for their duties as director is paid to their trade union organization.\n** As required by law, the Company deducted withholding tax on the amounts paid to these non-resident beneficiaries. A 30% deduction at source for income tax and CSG/\n\nCRDS social security contributions was also applied to amounts paid to beneficiaries tax-resident in France.\n\nThe non-executive directors did not receive any compensation \nother than the above compensation, with the exception of the \ndirectors representing either employee shareholders (Ms.\xa0Lucia \nSinapi-Thomas) or Group employees (Messrs.

Compensation components paid \nor granted in respect of 2020 were defined based on the ofice \nheld and the policies approved by the Shareholders’ Meeting of \nMay\xa020, 2020 and break down as follows:\n\n—  the compensation policy for the Chairman and Chief \nExecutive Oficer (Executive Corporate Oficer), ofice held \nby Mr. Paul hermelin up to the Shareholders’ Meeting of \nMay\xa020, 2020; \n\n—  the compensation policy for the Chief Operating Oficer \n(Executive Corporate Oficer), ofice held by Mr. Aiman Ezzat \nup to the Shareholders’ Meeting of May\xa020, 2020; \n\n—  the compensation policy for the Chief Executive Oficer \n(Executive Corporate Oficer), ofice held by Mr. Aiman Ezzat \nfollowing the Shareholders’ Meeting of May\xa020, 2020; \n\n— t he compensation policy for the Chairman (non-Executive \nCorporate Oficer), ofice held by Mr. Paul hermelin following \nthe Shareholders’ Meeting of May\xa020, 2020.\n\n\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE \nCompensation of corporate officers\n\nCAPGEMINI 83\n\n2.\n\nFor 2021, given the separation of the duties of Chairman (non-\nExecutive Corporate Oficer) and Chief Executive Oficer (Executive \nCorporate Oficer), the executive and non-Executive Corporate \nOficer compensation policy, in addition to the director compensation \npolicy, will comprise:\n\n—  the compensation policy for the Chief Executive Oficer \n(Executive Corporate Oficer), ofice held by Mr. Aiman Ezzat \n\nThe Executive Corporate Oficer compensation policy is consistent \nwith the Company’s interests and contributes to the Company’s \ncommercial strategy and long-term success in so far as it:\n\n—  is determined according to clear and quantifiable criteria, \nlinked to the Group’s strategy; \n\n—  includes incentives that reflect the Group’s strategic focus on \nlong-term profitable growth; \n\n—  provides for variable and long-term compensation linked in \npart to CSR criteria; \n\n—  aligns the interests of Executive Corporate Oficers with \nthose of the Company and shareholders.\n\nsince the Shareholders’ Meeting of May\xa020, 2020; \n\n—  the compensation policy for the Chairman (non-Executive \nCorporate Oficer), ofice held by Mr. Paul hermelin since the \nShareholders’ Meeting of May\xa020, 2020.\n\n2.3.2.1  General Principles \n\nCompliance and transparency\n\nThe procedures for setting Executive Corporate Oficer compensation \ncomply with the recommendations set out in the most recent version \nof the AFEP-MEDEF Code. Compensation components and structure \nare determined in accordance with the recommendations of this \nCode, whether fixed or variable compensation, the grant of equity \ninstruments or supplementary pension benefits and are in line with \nexisting Group practices and market rules. These principles are \nregularly reviewed and discussed by the Compensation Committee \nwhich submits a report on its work and its resulting proposals to \nthe Board of Directors for approval. Compensation components \nare disclosed in detail as part of the Say on Pay procedure.\n\nCompetitiveness and consistency\n\nThe Compensation Committee refers in particular to comparative \nstudies to ensure the consistency and competitiveness of both \nthe compensation level and structure and calculation methods with \nmarket practice. The Committee’s recommendations take account \nof Executive Management compensation levels and components in \nCAC\xa040 companies as well as observed practice in leading French and \nforeign Group competitors in the IT services and consulting sector. \nCompensation publication practice varies significantly between \nthe countries and legal structures of competitors, in particular in \nthe case of private partnerships. CAC\xa040 companies are therefore \nthe most relevant and most transparent benchmark, but additional \nanalyses take account of the international and competitive aspects \nof the sector and geographies in which the Company operates.\n\nBalance and performance\n\nWhen performing comparisons with French companies of \ncomparable size and ambition, the Compensation Committee \nensures that Capgemini’s practices are in line with the best \npractices of CAC\xa040 companies in terms of both the clarity and \nconsistency of methods applied. As in previous years, the Group \nparticipated in 2020 in comparative studies of the main French \ncompanies carried out by specialist firms. Accordingly, during the \nChief Operating Oficer appointment process at the beginning \nof 2018, a study was commissioned from an international firm \nto assist with setting compensation levels in accordance with \nexisting practice within the Group and current practices on the \nFrench market and international benchmarks. Another study \nwas commissioned from the same firm to assist with setting the \ncompensation level of the Chief Executive Oficer, as part of the \nchange in the Group’s governance. The Compensation Committee \nalso ensures that the respective proportions of fixed and variable \ncomponents and share grants valued in accordance with IFRS are \nbalanced, in line with market practices, linked to the Company’s \nperformance and aligned to Group strategy.\n\nConsistency with the Company’s interests and \ncontribution to the commercial strategy\n\nConflict of interest\n\nThe Board of Directors has implemented a conflict of interest \nmanagement procedure under which directors are required to \nnotify the Chairman of the Ethics & Governance Committee of \nany one-off or potential conflicts of interests and to refrain from \nattending deliberations and voting on the related decision (see \nSection\xa02.1.3\xa0on the absence of conflicts of interest).\n\nFurthermore, in accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code, the \nBoard of Directors deliberates on Executive Corporate Oficers \ncompensation in their absence.\n\n2.3.2.2  Compensation policy – Chief Executive \nOfficer (Executive Corporate Officer)\n\nTogether with the general principles set out above, the items \npresented below comply with Article 22-10-8\xa0 of the French \nCommercial Code and represent the Board of Directors’ report \non the Chief Executive Officer compensation policy that will \nbe presented for approval to shareholders at the Shareholders’ \nMeeting of May\xa020, 2021.\n\nCompensation structure\n\nThe Chief Executive Oficer compensation policy seeks a balance \nbetween short-term and long-term performance to ensure the \nsustainable development of the Company and aims for consistency \nbetween changes in overall compensation and Company performance \ntrends.\n\nProcedures for setting fixed and variable \ncompensation\n\nThe procedures for setting Executive Corporate Oficer compensation \nin respect of fiscal year Y are adopted by the Board of Directors’ \nmeeting in Y held to approve the financial statements for fiscal year \nY-1. The Board of Directors therefore approves at the beginning \nof the year for the year in progress:\n\n —  Fixed component \n\nFixed compensation seeks to reward the responsibilities associated \nwith the ofice. It takes into account the complexity of the position’s \nduties and responsibilities and the skills, expertise and experience \nrequired as well as the competitive position.\n\nThe fixed component is not reviewed annually, but after several \nyears in accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code. however, in the \nevent of a significant change in the scope of responsibilities or a \nmajor difference in positioning compared with the market, a review \ncould be envisaged based on clearly explained reasons. The fixed \nportion is paid in 12\xa0equal monthly installments and represents \n50% of the total theoretical compensation if objectives are attained \nfor the Chief Executive Oficer, since the Shareholders’ Meeting \nof May\xa02020.\n\n\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE \nCompensation of corporate officers\n\n84 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n2.\n\n —  Theoretical variable compensation: components and \ncalculation method\n\nTaking into account market practice for Executive Corporate Oficers, \nthe Board of Directors decided to progressively increase the \npercentage of theoretical variable compensation if objectives are \nattained to 100% of fixed compensation for Executive Corporate \nOficers. This target objective of 100% of fixed compensation now \napplies to the Chief Executive Oficer.\n\nIn the event of an appointment or departure during a fiscal year, \nthe variable component is calculated based on the percentage \ndefined in this way, pro rata to the period the ofice is exercised \nduring the relevant fiscal year.\n\nThe Board also set the procedure for calculating the variable \ncomponent of the Chief Executive Oficer’s compensation, defining \nthe performance indicators underlying the variable compensation \ncalculation, as well as the strategic individual performance objectives \nset for the year.\n\nThe variable compensation breaks down as follows:\n\n—  quantifiable performance indicators for 80% of the theoretical \nvariable compensation based on:\n\n–  financial performance indicators for 60%, the Board of \nDirectors having decided to increase the weight of the \nfinancial component to 60% from 2020 so as to increase \nthe impact of financial performance indicators on \ndetermining the variable compensation. The calculation \nstructure and weighting are stable over time and the \nlevel of attainment of these indicators is determined \nbased on a comparison of actual audited and budgeted \nGroup consolidated results. The performance indicators \nare adopted in line with the key indicators presented \nregularly to the market and are also stable over time. \nThis component varies in line with its theoretical level, \nbetween nil and a ceiling of 200% and is calculated using \na formula that accelerates the weighted performance \nof financial indicators upwards or downwards, such \nthat a one-point change in the economic performance \nhas a four-point impact on the calculation of the variable \ncomponent, under a risk/reward approach. This component \nis therefore nil if the weighted performance of financial \nindicators is less than or equal to 75% and can reach twice \nthe theoretical amount if the weighted performance is \n\ngreater than or equal to 125%, varying on a straight-line \nbasis between these two limits.\n\n–  quantifiable performance indicators for 20%, based on \nthe attainment of strategic objectives set by the Board of \nDirectors. The quantifiable objectives can vary between \nnil and 200%.\n\n–  qualitative indicators for 20% of the theoretical \nvariable compensation, based upon the attainment \nof individual qualitative objectives set by the Board of \nDirectors. Purely qualitative objectives are capped for \n2021 at 100% of their theoretical amount.\n\nThe Board of Directors therefore ensured that the objectives set \ncould be objectively assessed and measured, such that 80% of the \ntotal variable compensation for the year is based on quantitative \ndata. Objectives must also be clearly tied to the roll out of the \nGroup’s strategic priorities approved by the Board of Directors as \nessential to the delivery of the long-term strategic plan.\n\nTherefore, as a result of this system, fixed plus variable compensation \nof the Chief Executive Officer may vary between 50% and a \nmaximum of 140% of the theoretical/target fixed plus variable \nannual compensation. The variable component and the total fixed \nplus variable compensation are therefore both capped and the \nvariable component for the year may not represent more than \nthe percentage of fixed compensation presented in the summary \ntable below, prepared according to the respective weightings of \nthe quantified and purely qualitative objectives set for the year.\n\nThe level of attainment of objectives and the amount of variable \ncompensation components are decided, pursuant to the \nrecommendations of the Compensation Committee, by the Board of \nDirectors’ meeting in Y+1\xa0held to approve the financial statements \nfor fiscal year Y. The Committee meets on several occasions before \nthe Board of Directors’ meeting to assess the percentage attainment \nof Executive Corporate Oficer objectives. A Committee meeting \nwas held at the end of 2020 and another in early 2021 to assess this \nperformance before the Board of Directors’ meeting which decides \nthe level of attainment by Executive Corporate Oficers of their \nobjectives. Objective attainment percentages are communicated \nannually for each criterion.\n\nVariable compensation is paid following approval by the Shareholders’ \nMeeting in Y+1\xa0of compensation components for fiscal year Y for \nall Executive Corporate Oficers.\n\nSummary table of the theoretical structure of fixed and variable compensation for the Chief Executive Officer\n\n \nChief Executive Officer (since the \n\nShareholders’ Meeting of May 20, 2020)\n\nTheoretical compensation structure, base 100 Target Min Max\n\nGross fixed compensation 50 50 50\n\nAnnual variable compensation – financial indicators 30 0 60\n\nAnnual variable compensation – quantifiable indicators 10 0 20\n\nAnnual variable compensation – qualitative objectives 10 0 10\n\nMulti-year variable compensation 0 0 0\n\nTheoretical total if objectives are attained 100 50 140\n\n% variable/fixed 100% 0% 180%\n\nCapgemini share‑based incentive policy procedures\n\nThe Group stopped granting stock options in 2009 and now grants \nperformance shares in accordance with the following principles:\n\n—  subject to performance and presence conditions: \nperformance shares are granted subject to the same \nconditions of presence and performance as applicable to \nother Group beneficiaries and all shares are subject to \nperformance and presence conditions. however, in the \n\nevent of inclusion of an outperformance clause, this clause \nwould not apply to Executive Corporate Oficers:\n\n–  the associated conditions are ambitious, as demonstrated \nby the effective share grant percentages for the seven \nfully vested plans of respectively 42.3% for the 2009 \nplan, 56.7% for the 2010 plan, 87.9% for the 2012 plan, \n83.9% for the 2013 plan, 82.5% for the 2014 and 2015 plans \nand 70.8% for the 2016 plan, of the number of shares \ninitially granted; \n\n\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE \nCompensation of corporate officers\n\nCAPGEMINI 85\n\n2.\n\n–  the performance conditions include internal (comprising \nsince 2018 CSR conditions) and external performance \nconditions in accordance with the AMF recommendation, \nand are calculated over a 3-year period to ensure sustainable \nperformance and to align Executive Corporate Oficer, \nshareholder and stakeholders interests in the long run; \n\n—  volume: the volume of shares granted to Executive \nCorporate Oficers pursuant to the resolutions presented \nto shareholder vote is limited (maximum of 10% of shares \navailable for grant set in the most recent resolution voted \non May\xa0 20, 2020). Overall, in 2020, the volume of shares \ngranted to Executive Corporate Oficers was well within \nthe cap set in the resolution, with total percentages of \n1.23% of the maximum authorized amount and 1.32% of the \namount effectively granted, compared with 3.78% and 4.17% \nrespectively in 2019; \n\n—  cap: the IFRS value of shares granted aims not to exceed \n100% of the theoretical annual cash compensation for a given \nyear, and over the past six years this value has ranged from \n60% to 95% of this theoretical annual cash compensation for \nExecutive Corporate Oficers; \n\n—  obligation to hold shares: in accordance with legal provisions, \nthe Board of Directors must set the number of vested shares \n\ngranted in connection to their ofice that Executive Corporate \nOficers must continue to hold until the termination of their \nofice.\n\nThe Board of Directors decided that vested performance shares \nrepresenting at least 50% of shares must be retained, where the \namount of shares held, valued at the share price on the vesting \ndate, represents less than a threshold expressed as a multiple of \nthe theoretical annual compensation (fixed and variable). Once \nthis threshold is reached, the obligation to retain performance \nshares only applies to one third of shares vested. Finally, the Board \nof Directors decided on February\xa014, 2018 that if the number of \nshares valued on the vesting date represents more than twice \nthe above threshold, then the obligation to hold shares that vest \nas a result of these grants would be set at 5% of vested shares. \nExecutive Corporate Oficers are therefore entitled to freely sell \ntheir shares as long as i) the value of their shares remains above \nthe latter threshold and ii) at least five percent of each share \ngrant is held until the termination of their ofice as Executive \nCorporate Oficer.\n\nThe threshold under which 50% of vested shares must be held \nuntil termination of his ofice has been set for the Chief Executive \nOficer at one year of his theoretical annual compensation (fixed \nand variable), applicable from the vesting date.\n\nIf the value of the portfolio held at  \nthe vesting date is:\n\n< one years’ fixed  \nand variable theoretical \ncompensation\n\n> one years’ fixed  \nand variable theoretical \ncompensation and  \n< two years’ fixed  \nand variable theoretical \ncompensation\n\n> two years’ fixed  \nand variable theoretical \ncompensation\n\nObligation to hold vested shares until  \nthe later of the end of the term of ofice  \nand the plan date\n\n50% 33.3% 5% subject to remaining \nabove the two-year \nthreshold\n\n—  ban on hedging: share hedging transactions are prohibited \nbefore the end of the mandatory holding period. This ban is \nincluded in the grant plan rules and applies to all beneficiaries, \nwho must acknowledge in writing that they will comply with \nthe plan rules. The ban applies since the first performance \nshare grant plan in 2009. In accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF \nCode recommendations, the Chief Executive Oficer gave a \nformal commitment to comply with this ban.\n\n—  effective presence required, subject to three exceptions: \neffective presence on the vesting date is required for shares \nto vest as per the terms of the plan rules with the exception \nof death, disability or retirement. In the case of retirement, \nshares still vest on scheduled dates as per plan rules and \nconditions. These presence conditions and exceptions have \napplied since the first performance share grant plan. In other \ncircumstances, the shares are forfeited.\n\n—  grant in the same periods: in accordance with the \nrecommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, performance \nshares are now granted in the same calendar periods and are \ndecided by either the Board of Directors’ meeting at the end \nof July or the following meeting held in October. This has \nbeen the case since 2015, as grants were performed in July in \n2015 and 2016 and in October in 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020.\n\nIf regulatory developments or any other circumstances make the \nuse of equity-based incentive instruments restrictive, impossible \nor economically inappropriate, use of a special purpose long-term \nincentive mechanism with the same terms, criteria and ceilings \ncould be envisaged.\n\nOne-off award\n\nA one-off award, if any, would only be applicable in case of an \nexternal hiring of an executive, with the need to buy out rights that \nwould be lost following this hiring decision. In such case, the award \nwould be proportionate to the lost amounts and implementation \nand payment of this remuneration would be subject to approval by \nShareholders’ Meeting pursuant to Article L.\xa0222-10-8.\n\nTermination clauses\n\nDuring the meeting of March\xa011, 2020, the Board of Directors \nconsidered that it was in the Company’s interest to maintain the \nexisting Chief Operating Oficer system for the Chief Executive \nOficer, in strict compliance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code. During its \nmeeting of March\xa018, 2021, the Board again considered it was in the \nCompany’s interest to maintain this system, which encompasses:\n\n —  A non‑compete obligation\n\nSubject to compliance with the non-competition obligation for a \nperiod of 12\xa0months as from the date of termination of his corporate \nofice, the Chief Executive Oficer may be entitled to a compensation \npayment equal to half of his theoretical gross compensation (fixed \nplus variable) if objectives are attained, applicable on the date of \ntermination of his duties as Chief Executive Oficer. The Board of \nDirectors can decide to lift this non-compete obligation on the \ndeparture of the Chief Executive Oficer. This compensation is \nspread over the application period of the clause and is not payable \nif the Chief Executive Oficer exercises his right to retire or is over \n65\xa0years old at the end of his term of ofice.\n\n\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE \nCompensation of corporate officers\n\n86 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n2.\n\n —  Capped severance pay subject to performance conditions \ndue in the event of termination of the duties of Chief \nExecutive Officer\n\nA severance indemnity will only be due to the Chief Executive \nOficer at the end of his term of ofice in case of a forced departure \nin connection with (i)\xa0a merger or spin-off affecting the Company, \n(ii)\xa0a change of control within the meaning of article L.\xa0233-3\xa0of the \nFrench Commercial Code, or (iii)\xa0a significant change in strategy \nof the Company or a fundamental disagreement with the Board \nof Directors. however, no severance pay shall be due if the Chief \nExecutive Oficer leaves the Company on his own initiative, is entitled \nto exercise his right to retire or is 65\xa0years old on the termination \nof his term of ofice or in the event of a gross negligence or serious \nmisconduct. The Board ensured strict performance conditions \nwere attached to severance pay in the event of termination of \nthe corporate ofice, based on the weighted performance of the \n\nfinancial indicators applicable to the variable component of the \nChief Executive Oficer’s compensation (tied to Group performance \nindicators and consolidated results), observed annually during the \nlast two full fiscal years preceding the termination of duties, with \na heavier weighting applied to the final year (60% compared with \n40% for the preceding year).\n\nThe Board will confirm the effective achievement of these \nperformance criteria.\n\nIn compliance with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF \nCode, the aggregate amount of (i)\xa0severance pay effectively paid, \nand (ii)\xa0any indemnity likely to be paid in consideration for the \nnon-compete undertaking, may not exceed a maximum amount \nequal to twice the applicable theoretical annual compensation \n(fixed plus variable) at the date of termination of the duties of \nChief Executive Oficer.\n\nSeverance pay on \ncessation of the \n\ncorporate office based  \non performance during \n\nthe previous 2 years\n\n(Payable solely in the event \nof forced departure)\n\n⊕\n\nIndemnities on the potential application  \nof a non‑compete clause on cessation  \n\nof the corporate office\n\nequal to half the theoretical gross compensation (fixed + \nvariable) applicable at the date of cessation of the duties \n\nof Chief Executive Oficer (i.e.  ≤ 1\xa0year)\n\nAbsolute cap of  \n2 years theoretical  \n\nannual compensation  \n(fixed + variable)\n\napplicable at the date of \ncessation of duties\n\nDirector compensation\n\nWithin the framework of the directors’ compensation policy \npresented in Section\xa02.3.1, the Chief Executive Oficer is eligible \nto receive remuneration for serving as a director. Mr. Aiman Ezzat \nhas however informed the Board of his decision to waive his right \nto compensation for his duties as a director.\n\nBenefits in kind\n\nIn addition to the above-mentioned items, the structure of the \nChief Executive Officer compensation may also comprise the \nprovision of a company car, under prevailing conditions within the \nexisting plan in place in France. The Chief Executive Oficer has \nnot however subscribed to this offer. The Chief Executive Oficer \nis covered by collective healthcare and welfare plans applicable \nwithin the Company.\n\nMulti‑year Variable Compensation\n\nLong savings plan\n\nOn the proposal of the Compensation Committee, the Board of \nDirectors decided that the Chief Executive Oficer can benefit \nfrom the long savings mechanism. This plan has been implemented \nsince 2016 to remain attractive for senior executives while being \nable to offer a long term incentive vehicle with better economic \nconditions for both the Company and the beneficiaries of the \nprevious plan which was closed to new entrants at the end of 2015 \nwith pension rights frozen. This mechanism is more aligned with \ndevelopments in the market and the European legal framework \n(portability, performance conditions, agility) and seeks to cover the \nabsence of contributions and therefore pension rights above eight \ntimes the French annual social security ceiling. The plan consists \nin the payment of an annual allowance, at least half of which is \nallocated to a third-party body in the context of a supplementary \noptional pension insurance plan (Article 82), with the rest of the \ncash allowance being kept by the beneficiary, considering the \nimmediate taxation upon entry of this mechanism.\n\nThis allowance is made under the following conditions:\n\n—  the allowance is subject to the attainment of performance \nconditions; \n\n—  the amount of the allowance if all objectives are attained is \nequal to 40% of the annual fixed compensation; it will vary \naccording to the unflexed weighted performance of the \nfinancial performance indicators used for the calculation of \nthe variable component; \n\n—  the payment of the allowance in respect of year Y, subject to \nthe satisfaction of the performance conditions for year Y, is \ndeferred as follows:\n–  50% of the amount calculated is paid in year Y+1,\n–  50% of the amount calculated is paid in year Y+2, provided \n\nthe Chief Executive Oficer is present in the Group at \nJune\xa030\xa0of year Y+2.\n\nThe calculation procedure and the objectives related to this \nallowance will be set each year by the Board of Directors, on the \nproposal of the Compensation Committee. The Board of Directors \ndecided that the calculation procedure, the Company’s internal \nperformance indicators taken into account for the calculation \nof the variable component linked to the financial performance \nindicators, and weighting associated with each indicator for fiscal \nyear 2021, will be set by the Board of Directors, on the proposal of \nthe Compensation Committee, during the meeting held to approve \nthe results for the year ended December\xa031, 2020. The calculation \nis performed over the effective duration of the current term of \nofice in a given year in the event of entry into or termination of \nduties during the year.\n\nSupplementary pension benefits\n\nThe Chief Executive Oficer is not covered by a supplementary \npension plan.\n\nApplication of the compensation policy to Mr. Aiman \nEzzat, Chief Executive Officer of Capgemini SE since \nthe Shareholders’ Meeting of May 20, 2020\n\n —  Fixed component \n\nAt the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the \nBoard of Directors decided to position Mr. Aiman Ezzat’s theoretical \nfixed compensation for his duties as Chief Executive Oficer in fiscal \nyear 2021 at €1,000,000, unchanged on fiscal year 2020, payable \nmonthly pro rata to his term of ofice in the fiscal year.\n\n\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE \nCompensation of corporate officers\n\nCAPGEMINI 87\n\n2.\n\n —  Variable component \n\nThe Board of Directors decided to leave Mr. Aiman Ezzat’s variable \ncompensation unchanged at 100% of his fixed compensation, that \nis an amount of €1,000,000, representing 50% of his total fixed plus \nvariable theoretical compensation. The 2021 variable component \nis based 80% on quantifiable performance indicators.\n\nFinancial indicators (60% of the variable component)\n\nVariable compensation is based 60% on financial indicators. The \ncomposition and relative weighting of these financial performance \nindicators for 2021 (as since 2013) are:\n\n—  growth for 30% (Group revenues); \n—  operating profitability for 30% (Group operating margin \n\nrate); \n—  cash generation for 20% (Group organic free cash flow); \n\n—  shareholders return for 20% (net profit before taxes).\n\nIndividual performance objectives account for 40% of variable \ncompensation, including 20% based on quantifiable objectives \nand 20% based on qualitative objectives. Individual performance \nobjectives set by the Board of Directors for the Chief Executive \nOficer for 2021 are:\n\nQuantifiable individual performance objectives (20% of the \nvariable component)\n\n—  Objective 1: implementation of the CSR strategy for 20%.\n\nQualitative individual performance objectives (20% of the \nvariable component)\n\n—  Objective 2: successful integration of Altran for 15%.\n—  Objective 3: Launch of the Intelligent Industry strategy for \n\n5%.\n\nIndividual performance objectives set by the Board of Directors for the Chief Executive Oficer for 2021 are:\n\nAmount\nof the\n\nfree-cash flow\nin 2020\n\nFinancial objectives\n\n30%30%20%20%\n\nPre-tax net\nprofit\n\nobjective\n\nOperating\nmargin rate\n\nobjective\nRevenue\nobjective\n\nPersonal objectives\n(including 50% quantifiable)\n\n12.5%37.5%50%\n\nAltran\n\nIntelligent \nIndustry\nstrategy CSR strategy\n\nAs the fixed compensation is €1,000,000, the amount applicable \nfor the long savings plan was set at €400,000 for 2021 and the \ntheoretical annual cash compensation is therefore two million, \n\nfour hundred thousand euros, with 58% subject to performance \nconditions.\n\n2021 annual compensation target structure:\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\n \n\n79.0%\n\n \nPerformance-\n\nbased\ncompensation\n\nANNUAL LONG-TERM\n\n50.0%\nPerformance\nshares\n\n29.0%\nVariable\n\ncompensation\n\n21.0%\nFixed\n\ncompensation\n\n2.3.2.3  Compensation policy – Chairman of the \nBoard of Directors\n\nTogether with the general principles set out above, the items \npresented below comply with Article 22-10-8\xa0 of the French \nCommercial Code and represent the Board of Directors’ report on \nthe Chairman of the Board of Directors’ compensation policy that \nwill be presented for approval to shareholders at the Shareholders’ \nMeeting of May\xa020, 2021.\n\nCompensation structure\n\nIn compliance with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF \nCode, the Chairman of the Board of Directors’ compensation \npolicy solely includes fixed compensation, the continuation of the \nsupplementary collective defined benefit pension plan closed and \nfrozen in 2015 and the coverage provided by the collective health \nand welfare plans applicable within the Company.\n\n\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE \nCompensation of corporate officers\n\n88 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n2.\n\nThe compensation structure therefore excludes the payment to \nthe Chairman of the Board of Directors of:\n\n—  annual or deferred variable compensation; \n—  equity-based instruments; \n—  exceptional compensation; \n—  severance pay.\n\nFixed compensation\n\nThe procedures for setting the compensation of the Chairman \nof the Board of Directors, a non-Executive Corporate Oficer, in \nrespect of fiscal year Y are adopted by the Board of Directors’ \nmeeting in Y held to approve the financial statements for fiscal year \nY-1. The Board of Directors therefore approves at the beginning \nof the year for the year in progress the fixed compensation that \nseeks to reward the responsibilities associated with the ofice and \ntakes into account the competitive position, based on a market \nstudy, the level and complexity of duties, the responsibilities of \nthe function, the skills, expertise and experience and the role of \nambassador for the Company’s image and guarantor of the Group’s \nvalues defined by its founder.\n\nThe fixed component is not reviewed annually, but after several \nyears in accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code. The fixed component \nis paid in 12\xa0equal monthly installments.\n\nOn this basis and at the recommendation of the Compensation \nCommittee, the Board of Directors decided to set the Chairman’s \ncompensation, subject to approval by the Shareholders’ Meeting, \nat €800,000\xa0from June\xa02020, payable monthly pro rata to his term \nof ofice in the fiscal year. For 2021, and at the recommendation \nof the Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors decided \nto leave the Chairman’s compensation unchanged, subject to the \nvote of the Shareholders’ Meeting of May\xa020, 2021.\n\nThe Board of Directors set this compensation taking account of Mr. \nhermelin’s specific role as Chairman of the Board in the context \nof the managerial succession. In this context, Mr. hermelin was \nappointed Chairman of the Strategy & CSR Committee and continues \nto represent the Company, in support of the Chief Executive \nOficer, in its high-level relations at national and international level, \nenabling Capgemini to continue to benefit from his experience and \nknowledge of the Group. When representing the Company with \nmajor clients and partners, he acts only with the full agreement \nof the Chief Executive Oficer and at his request. The Chairman \nis also responsible for promoting the Group’s values, culture and \nreputation. This managerial succession period will not exceed two \nyears, terminating at the end of the 2022 Shareholders’ Meeting.\n\nDirector compensation\n\nUnder the Director compensation policy presented in Section\xa02.3.1, \nthe Chairman is eligible to receive director compensation. The \nChairman has however already indicated that he will waive his \nright to such compensation for his duties as a director, as he has \nnow done for over a decade.\n\nSupplementary pension benefits\n\nMr. Paul hermelin is a member of the supplementary collective \ndefined benefit pension plan (Article 39) set up in 2006 in Capgemini \nService, under the same conditions applicable to other employee \nmembers. This plan was reviewed by an external firm which \nconfirmed that it complies with the AFEP-MEDEF recommendations \nof October\xa06, 2009 and also the revised AFEP-MEDEF Governance \nCode issued in June\xa02013.\n\nThe plan was closed to new beneficiaries in 2015 and rights of \nexisting members have been frozen as of October\xa031, 2015.\n\nIn order to receive benefits under this plan, it is necessary to be \nwith the Group at the time of retirement, to have at least 10\xa0years \nof seniority, to have been a Group Executive Committee member \nfor at least five years and to have a compensation level above eight \ntimes the French annual social security ceiling (PASS) during five \nyears at least.\n\nBenefits are based on reference earnings equal to the average of \nthe three best years (fixed and variable components) from among \nthe ten years preceding retirement.\n\nIn addition, this supplementary pension is subject to three cumulative \nlimits such that the pension amount cannot exceed:\n\n—  40% of reference earnings; \n—  50% of reference earnings, including pensions received \n\nunder all other pension plans; and\n—  reference earnings are capped at 60\xa0times the French annual \n\nsocial security ceiling.\n\nBenefits are proportional to length of service (minimum of 10\xa0years \nrequired and a maximum of 30\xa0years), reflecting the required \nprogressive acquisition of entitlement, which remains well below \nthe threshold set by the AFEP-MEDEF Code and the recent legal \nceiling of 3% per annum. Entitlement is acquired at a rate of 1.5% \nper year for the first 10\xa0years of seniority and for subsequent \nyears only at rates of:\n\n—  1% up to 20\xa0times the French annual social security ceiling; \n— 2 % between 20 and 40\xa0times the French annual social security \n\nceiling; \n— 3 % between 40 and 60\xa0times the French annual social security \n\nceiling; \n\nTherefore, the maximum possible annual entitlement is equal to \n1.83% before the potential impact of the cumulative limits. Due \nto the long seniority of our Chairman (frozen at 23\xa0years in 2015), \nthe value of the annual pension is estimated at a net amount \nafter income tax and employee social contributions of K€296, \ncorresponding to a gross amount of K€887.\n\nThe plan is financed through an external insurance company and as \nsuch the required funds to pay the pension support a contribution \nof 24%. 21\xa0members have benefited from this plan since its launch \nwith seven presently active as of December\xa031, 2020.\n\n\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE \nCompensation of corporate officers\n\nCAPGEMINI 89\n\n2.\n\n2.3.3  Compensation paid in 2020 or granted in respect of 2020 to \nExecutive Corporate Officers\n\n2.3.3.1  2020 compensation of the Chairman and \nChief Executive Officer, Mr. Paul Hermelin \n(up to May 20, 2020)\n\nThe following table summarizes the components calculated in \napplication of the Chairman and Chief Executive Oficer compensation \npolicy approved by the Shareholders’ Meeting of May\xa020, 2020, \nwhich remain subject to approval by the Combined Shareholders’ \nMeeting of May\xa020, 2021 (for more information, see Chapter\xa07\xa0of \nthis Universal Registration Document).\n\nAs a reminder, in the context of the health crisis tied to the Covid-19 \npandemic, the Executive Corporate Oficers, in solidarity with \nemployees and the Company’s ecosystem did not receive, with the \n\nconsent of the Board of Directors in its April\xa027, 2020 session, 25% \nof their annual fixed and variable compensation for 2020, thereby \ngoing beyond the AFEP MEDEF recommendations.\n\nThis led to an overall reduction in compensation for these two \nExecutive Corporate Oficers of €842,721, including €390,866 for \nMr. Paul hermelin, which has no impact on the compensation policy \napproved by the May\xa020, 2020 Shareholders’ Meeting, which has \nbeen applied strictly according to the objectives set by the Board \nof Directors in its March\xa011, 2020 meeting, objectives set therefore \nexcluding the acquisition of Altran.\n\nIn accordance with its commitment, the Company paid €640,000\xa0to \nthe Pasteur Institute to finance research into Covid-19.\n\n(gross amount) Compensation for 2019 Compensation for 2020 \n\nMr. Paul Hermelin: Chairman and Chief  Granted  \nin 2019,  \n\npaid in 2020\n\nGranted  \nin 2020,  \n\npaid in 2021 \nExecutive Officer (up to the Shareholders’ Paid in  \n\n2019\nTotal  \n2019\n\nPaid in  \n2020 \n\nTotal  \n2020 Meeting of May 20, 2020)\n\nFixed compensation (1)  1,452,000 - 1,452,000 605,000 - 605,000 \n\nAnnual variable compensation (1)  - 1,311,780 1,311,780 - 491,800 491,800 \n\nMulti-year variable compensation - - - - - - \n\nExceptional compensation - - - - - - \n\nCompensation for duties as a director - - - - - - \n\nBenefits in kind - - - - - - \n\nTOTAL COMPENSATION PAID  \nOR GRANTED IN RESPECT OF THE  \nFISCAL YEAR (1)  1,452,000 1,311,780 2,763,780 605,000 491,800 1,096,800 \n\nIn addition, the value of performance shares granted during the fiscal year and valued as per the IFRS rules on the grant date is reported \nbelow\xa0:\n\n(gross amount) Compensation for 2019 Compensation for 2020 \n\nMr. Paul Hermelin: Chairman and Chief  \nExecutive Officer (up to the Shareholders’ \nMeeting of May 20, 2020)\n\nGranted  \nin 2019\n\nTotal  \n2019\n\nGranted  \nin 2020 \n\nTotal  \n2020 \n\nValue of multi-year variable compensation \ngranted in respect of the fiscal year - - - - \n\nValue of options granted during the fiscal year - - - - \n\nValue of performance shares granted during the \nfiscal year 2,075,466 2,075,466\n\nTOTAL GRANTED 2,075,466 2,075,466\n\nTOTAL (1)  4 839 246 1,096,800 \n\nTOTAL POST REDUCTION (2)  822,600 \n\n   \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n\n     \n\n(1) Compensation which will be paid or granted to the Chairman and CEO, in compliance with the compensation policy approved by the May\xa020, 2020 Shareholders’ Meeting. \nbefore the 25% reduction of his 2020 annual fixed and variable compensation, in the context of the health crisis tied to the Covid-19 pandemic\n\n(2) Compensation which will be paid or granted to the Chairman and CEO following the 25% reduction of his 2020 annual fixed and variable compensation, in the context of \nthe health crisis tied to the Covid-19 pandemic\n\n\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE \nCompensation of corporate officers\n\n90 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n2.\n\nFixed\n\n55%\n€1,096,800*\n\nVariable\nperformance\n\nrelated\n\nDirector compensation\n\nVoluntary waiver\n\nBenfits in kind\n\n€0\n45%\n\n€0\n\nFixed and variable compensatione (cash)\n\nNon-compete clause\n\n€0\nTaking into account the separation \n\nof the duties of Chairman of the \n\nBoard of Directors and Chief \n\nExecutive Officer on May 20, 2020,\n\nM.

It \nrepresents 55% of the total theoretical compensation if objectives are attained and is reviewed \nat long intervals in accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code. This amount is unchanged since \n2013 when it was increased by 10% to reflect the change in Mr. Paul hermelin’s role who became \nChairman and Chief Executive Oficer at the end of the Combined Shareholders’ Meeting of \nMay\xa024, 2012, the extension of his responsibilities and the development and internationalization \nof the Group since 2008, when his compensation was last modified. The annualized increase in \nhis theoretical compensation since 2008 and therefore in his fixed compensation is less than \n0.9% per annum. This theoretical compensation falls within the average of CAC\xa040 executives. \nFurthermore, given the change in the Group’s governance following the Shareholders’ Meeting \nof May\xa02020, the fixed compensation effectively paid in 2020 in respect of Mr. Paul hermelin’s \nduties was prorated 5/12th, representing an amount of €605,000.\n\nAnnual  \nvariable \ncompensation\n\n€491,800  \n(paid in 2021 in \nrespect of 2020)\n\nReminder: \n€1,311,780  \n(paid in 2020 in \nrespect of 2019 \nafter approval  \nby the \nShareholders’ \nMeeting)\n\nDuring the Board of Directors’ meeting of March\xa018, 2021, the Board, based on the audited and \napproved accounts and at the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, assessed the \namount of Mr. Paul hermelin’s variable compensation for fiscal year 2020, of a target amount if \nobjectives are attained of €1,200,000, i.e. 45% of his total theoretical compensation and 82.6% \nof his fixed compensation and comprising two equal components, V1 and V2, that may vary \nbetween 0% and 200% of the theoretical amount for quantifiable objectives and 0% and 100% \nof the theoretical amount for purely qualitative objectives. Furthermore, given the change \nin the Group’s governance following the Shareholders’ Meeting of May\xa02020, the variable \ncompensation in respect of Mr. Paul hermelin’s duties was calculated based on 5/12th\xa0of the \ntheoretical amount, that is €500,000.\n\n\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE \nCompensation of corporate officers\n\nCAPGEMINI 91\n\n2.\n\n \n\nAmount or \naccounting value \nsubject to vote Presentation\n\n  V1 component: this component is calculated in accordance with quantifiable criteria and the \nfollowing respective weightings, all relating to the financial results as compared to objectives \nset by the Board at the beginning of the year, which remained unchanged despite the \nhealth crisis related to the Covid‑19 pandemic:\n\n1) % attainment of revenues: 30% weighting ;\n2) % attainment of the operating margin rate: 30% weighting ;\n3) % attainment of pre-tax net profit: 20% weighting ;\n4) % attainment of free cash flow: 20% weighting.\n\nThese objectives were assessed with respect to the objectives set by the Board of Directors’ \nmeeting of March\xa011, 2020.\n\nAttainment rates for these four objectives were 93.2%, 90.9%, 101.4% and 105.8% respectively, \nwhich, taking account of the relative weighting of each objective, gives a weighted attainment \nrate of 96.68%.\n\nThe Group’s historical calculation formula accelerates actual performance upwards or downwards \nsuch that for 2020:\n\n—  if the weighted performance of the above four financial indicators is less than or equal to \n75%, the V1 component will be nil; \n\n—  if the weighted performance of the above four financial indicators is greater than or equal \nto 125%, the V1 component will be capped and equal to twice its theoretical amount; \n\n—  accordingly, a one-point variance in the weighted attainment rate increases or decreases \nthe variable component by 4%; \n\n—  a weighted rate of 96.68% in 2020 results in the multiplication of the theoretical variable \ncomponent by 86.72%.\n\n—  giving a final V1 amount of €1,200,000/2*5/12 x 86.72% equal to €216,800.\n\n  V2 component: the assessment and associated proposal were based on work performed by \nthe Compensation Committee, which reviewed the various individual performance objectives \ngrouped into two categories: “quantifiable objectives” for 50% and “individual performance \nobjectives” for 50%.\n\nFor the quantifiable objectives, the Board defined two sets of indicators evenly spread around i) \nthe deployment of the CSR strategy and (ii)\xa0completion of the acquisition of Altran Technologies. \nThe quantifiable objectives set by the Board at the beginning of the year remained unchanged.\n\n  The first set of quantifiable objectives concerned the deployment of the CSR strategy focusing \non diversity and environmental responsibility. The diversity objective was measured based \non the % of women in key senior executive positions, with a 2-point improvement objective \nin 2020. This ambitious objective was attained and even slightly exceeded. With regards to \nenvironmental responsibility, the objective was a 5% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions/\nemployee during the fiscal year. This objective was largely exceeded mainly due to the marked \nreduction in business travel because of the health crisis tied to the Covid-19 pandemic. On this \nbasis, the Board considered the objectives set for the first part of quantifiable component \nto be attained 140%.\n\nThe second set of quantifiable objectives concerned the completion of the Altran acquisition, which \nwas considered to be achieved. Therefore, given these achievements, the Board considered \nthe objectives set for the quantifiable component to be attained 120%. \n\n  As regards the specific individual performance objectives, the Board set as an objective \nthe quality of the Chairman’s hand-over to the newly appointed Chief Executive Oficer in \nthe context of the changes in the Group’s governance. Based on work conducted by the Lead \nIndependent Director with Board members, the Board considered the objectives set for this \ncategory to be attained 100%.\n\n\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE \nCompensation of corporate officers\n\n92 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n2.\n\nAmount or \naccounting value \nsubject to vote Presentation\n\n The Board approved a weighted performance of 110% as per the table below:\n\nTarget \nobjective\n\nAttainment \nlevel\n\nWeighted \nattainmentObjective Min Max\n\nCSR strategy – diversity 0% 12.5% 25% 120% 15%\n\nCSR strategy – sustainable development 0% 12.5% 25% 160% 20%\n\nCompletion of the Altran acquisition 0% 25.0% 50% 100% 25%\n\nhand-over 0% 50.0% 50% 100% 50%\n\nTotal 0% 100% 150% 110% 110%\n\nTarget amount (in €) 0 600,000 900,000\n\nProrated target amount (5/12) 0 250,000 375,000 250,000\n\nProposed amount (in €) 275,000\n\n  \n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\nAccordingly, variable compensation of €491,800 was approved by the Board for 2020, i.e. 81.3% \nof fixed compensation prorated for this fiscal year and 98.4% of the theoretical variable \ncompensation.

This plan was reviewed by an external firm which confirmed that \nit complies with the AFEP-MEDEF recommendations of October\xa06, 2009, and also the revised \nAFEP-MEDEF Governance Code.\n\nThe plan was closed to new beneficiaries in 2015 and rights of existing members have been \nfrozen as of October 31, 2015.\n\nIn order to receive benefits under this plan, it is necessary to be with the Group at the time of \nretirement, to have at least 10\xa0years of seniority, to have been a Group Executive Committee \nmember for at least five years and to have a compensation level above eight times the French \nannual social security ceiling (PASS) during five years at least.\n\nBenefits are based on reference earnings equal to the average of the three best years (fixed \nand variable components) from among the ten years preceding retirement.\n\nIn addition, this supplementary pension is subject to three cumulative limits such that the \npension amount cannot exceed:\n\n—  40% of reference earnings; \n— 5 0% of reference earnings, including pensions received under all other pension plans; and\n—  reference earnings are capped at 60\xa0times the French annual social security ceiling.\n\n\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE \nCompensation of corporate officers\n\n94 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n2.\n\n \nAmount  \nsubject to vote Presentation\n\n  Benefits are proportional to length of service (minimum of 10\xa0years required and a maximum \nof 30\xa0years), reflecting the required progressive acquisition of entitlement, which remains \nwell below the threshold set by the AFEP-MEDEF Code and the recent legal ceiling of 3% per \nannum.

Due to the long seniority of our Chairman and Chief Executive \nOficer (frozen at 23\xa0years in 2015), the value of the annual pension is estimated at a net \namount after income tax and employee social contributions of K€296, corresponding to a \ngross amount of K€887 or 34% of his last theoretical compensation for his duties as Chairman \nand Chief Executive Oficer.\n\nThe plan is financed through an external insurance company and as such the required funds \nto pay the pension support a contribution of 24%.\n\nTwenty-one members have benefited from this plan since its launch with seven presently \nactive at December\xa031, 2020.\n\nPresented to the Combined Shareholders’ Meeting of April\xa026, 2007\n\nFourth resolution in respect of regulated agreements.\n\n2.3.3.2  2020 compensation of the Chief Operating \nOfficer: Mr. Aiman Ezzat (up to May 20, 2020)\n\nThe following table summarizes the components calculated in \napplication of the Chief Operating Oficer compensation policy \napproved by the Shareholders’ Meeting of May\xa020, 2020, which \nremain subject to approval by the Combined Shareholders’ \nMeeting of May\xa020, 2021 (for more information, see Chapter\xa07\xa0of \nthis Universal Registration Document).\n\nAs a reminder, in the context of the health crisis tied to the Covid-19 \npandemic, the Executive Corporate Oficers, in solidarity with \nemployees and the Company’s ecosystem did not receive, with the \nconsent of the Board of Directors in its April\xa027, 2020 session, 25% \nof their annual fixed and variable compensation for 2020, thereby \ngoing beyond the AFEP MEDEF recommendations.\n\nThis led to an overall reduction in compensation for these two \nExecutive Corporate Oficers of €842,721, including €451,855 for \nMr. Aiman Ezzat, which has no impact on the compensation policy \napproved by the May\xa020, 2020 Shareholders’ Meeting, which has \nbeen applied strictly according to the objectives set by the Board \nof Directors in its March\xa011, 2020 meeting, objectives set therefore \nexcluding the acquisition of Altran.\n\nIn accordance with its commitment, the Company paid €640,000\xa0to \nthe Pasteur Institute to finance research into Covid-19.\n\n(gross amount) Compensation for 2019 Compensation for 2020 \n\nAiman Ezzat: Chief Operating  \nOfficer from January 1, 2018  \nto the Shareholders’ Meeting  \nof May 20, 2020\n\nGranted  \nin 2019, \n\npaid in \n2020\n\nGranted  \nin 2019, \n\npaid in  \n2021\n\nGranted  \nin 2020, \n\npaid in \n2021 \n\nGranted  \nin 2020, \n\npaid in \n2022 \n\nPaid in  \n2019\n\nTotal  \n2019\n\nPaid in \n2020 \n\nTotal \n2020 \n\nFixed compensation (1)  936,000 - - 936,000 390,000 - - 390,000 \n\nAnnual variable compensation (1)  - 650,926 - 650,926 - 262,236 - 262,236 \n\nMulti-year variable compensation - 190,388 190,388 380,776 - 75,531 75,531 151,062 \n\nExceptional compensation - - - - - - - - \n\nCompensation for duties as a director - - - - - - - - \n\nBenefits in kind - - - - - - - - \n\nTotal compensation paid or granted \nin respect of the fiscal year (1)  936,000 841,314 190,388 1,967,702 390,000 337,767 75,531 803,298 \n\n\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE \nCompensation of corporate officers\n\nCAPGEMINI 95\n\n2.\n\nIn addition, the value of performance shares granted during the fiscal year and valued as per the IFRS rules on the grant date is  \nreported below:\n\nAiman Ezzat: Chief Operating  \nOfficer from January 1, 2018  \nto the Shareholders’ Meeting of \nMay 20, 2020\n\nGranted  \nin 2019\n\nTotal  \n2019\n\nGranted  \nin 2020 \n\nTotal \n2020 \n\nValue of multi-year variable \ncompensation granted in respect  \nof the fiscal year - - - - \n\nValue of options granted during  \nthe fiscal year - - - - \n\nValue of performance shares  \ngranted during the fiscal year 1,408,352 1,408,352 - - \n\nTOTAL GRANTED 1,408,352 1,408,352 - - \n\nTOTAL (1)   3,376,054  - 803,298 \n\nTOTAL POST REDUCTION (2)     640,239 \n\n(1) Compensation which will be paid or granted to the Chief Operating Oficer, in compliance with the compensation policy approved by the May\xa020, 2020 Shareholders’ \nMeeting. before the 25% reduction of his 2020 annual fixed and variable compensation, in the context of the health crisis tied to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n(2) Compensation which will be paid or granted to the Chief Operating Oficer following the 25% reduction of his 2020 annual fixed and variable compensation, in the context \nof the health crisis tied to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nFixed\n\n49%\n€803,298*\n\nVariable\nperformance\n\nrelated\n\nDirector compensation\n\nN/A\n\nBenfits in kind\n\n€0\n51%\n\n€0\n\nFixed and variable compensation (cash)\n\nNon-compete clause\n\n€0\nTaking into account the separation \n\nof the duties of Chairman of the \n\nBoard of Directors and Chief \n\nExecutive Officer on May 20, 2020, \n\nM.

It \nrepresents 60% of the total theoretical compensation if objectives are attained and is reviewed \nat long intervals in accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code. This amount was proposed following \nthe appointment as of January\xa01, 2018 of Mr. Aiman Ezzat as Chief Operating Oficer and \napproved by the Combined Shareholders’ Meetings of May\xa023, 2018, May\xa020, 2019 and May\xa020, \n2020. Furthermore, given the change in the Group’s governance following the Shareholders’ \nMeeting of May\xa02020, the compensation effectively paid in 2020 in respect of Mr. Aiman Ezzat’s \nduties was prorated 5/12th, representing an amount of €390,000.\n\nAnnual  \nvariable \ncompensation\n\n€262,236  \n(paid in 2021 in \nrespect of 2020)\n\nReminder:  \n€650,926  \n(paid in 2020 in \nrespect of 2019 \nafter approval  \nby the \nShareholders’ \nMeeting)\n\nDuring the Board of Directors’ meeting of March\xa018, 2021, the Board, based on the audited and \napproved accounts and at the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, assessed the \namount of Mr. Aiman Ezzat’s variable compensation for fiscal year 2020, of a full-year target \namount if objectives are attained of €624,000, i.e. 40% of his total theoretical compensation \nand 66.6% of his fixed compensation and comprising two equal components, V1 and V2, that \nmay vary between 0% and 200% of the theoretical amount for quantifiable objectives and \n0% and 100% of the theoretical amount for purely qualitative objectives. Furthermore, given \nthe change in the Group’s governance following the Shareholders’ Meeting of May\xa02020, the \nvariable compensation in respect of Mr. Aiman Ezzat’s duties was calculated based on 5/12th\xa0of \nthe theoretical amount, that is €260,000.\n\nV1 component: this component is calculated in accordance with quantifiable criteria and the \nfollowing respective weightings, all relating to the financial results as compared to objectives \nset by the Board at the beginning of the year, which remained unchanged despite the \nhealth crisis related to the Covid‑19 pandemic:\n\n1)  % attainment of revenues: 30% weighting; \n2)  % attainment of the operating margin rate: 30% weighting; \n3)  % attainment of pre-tax net profit: 20% weighting; \n4)  % attainment of free cash flow: 20% weighting.\n\nThese objectives were assessed with respect to the objectives set by the Board of Directors’ \nmeeting of March\xa011, 2020.\n\n  Attainment rates for these four objectives were 93.2%, 90.9%, 101.4% and 105.8% respectively, \nwhich, taking account of the relative weighting of each objective, gives a weighted attainment \nrate of 96.68%.\n\nThe Group’s historical calculation formula accelerates actual performance upwards or downwards \nsuch that for 2020:\n\n—  if the weighted performance of the above four financial indicators is less than or equal to \n75%, the V1 component will be nil; \n\n—  if the weighted performance of the above four financial indicators is greater than or equal \nto 125%, the V1 component will be capped and equal to twice its theoretical amount; \n\n—  accordingly, a one-point variance in the weighted attainment rate increases or decreases \nthe variable component by 4%; \n\n—  a weighted rate of 96.68% in 2020 results in the multiplication of the theoretical variable \ncomponent by 86.72%.\n\n—  giving a final V1 amount of €624,000/2 x 5/12 x 86.72%, equal to €112,736.\n\nV2 component: the assessment and associated proposal were based on work performed by \nthe Compensation Committee, which reviewed the various individual performance objectives \ngrouped into two categories: “quantifiable objectives” for 50% and “individual performance \nobjectives” for 50%. It is recalled that as part of the announced change in the Group’s governance \nwith the transition by Mr. Aiman Ezzat from Chief Operating Oficer to Chief Executive Oficer \nfrom the Shareholders’ Meeting of May\xa02020, the Board set objectives on an annual basis \nwith the same objectives for the holder of both the aforementioned ofices. The quantifiable \nobjectives set by the Board at the beginning of the year remained unchanged.\n\nThe first set of quantifiable objectives concerned growth in Digital and Cloud offers. Published \ngrowth exceeded 16% above the target set initially by the Board, which the Board considered \nto be a very good performance in the 2020 context of the pandemic. On this basis the Board \nassessed the attainment rate for the first set of quantifiable objectives to be 120%. \n\n\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE \nCompensation of corporate officers\n\nCAPGEMINI 97\n\n2.\n\n \n\nAmount or \naccounting value \nsubject to vote Presentation\n\n  The second set of quantifiable objectives concerned the deployment of the CSR strategy focusing \non diversity and environmental responsibility. The diversity objective was measured based \non the % of women in key senior executive positions, with a 2-point improvement objective \nin 2020. This ambitious objective was attained and even slightly exceeded. With regards to \nenvironmental responsibility, the objective was a 5% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions/\nemployee during the fiscal year. This objective was largely exceeded mainly due to the marked \nreduction in business travel because of the health crisis tied to the Covid-19 pandemic. The \nBoard assessed the attainment rate for the second set of quantifiable objectives to be 140%.\n\nTherefore, given these achievements, the Board considered the objectives set for the \nquantifiable component to be attained 130%.\n\nThe Board defined three specific individual performance objectives.\n\nThe first specific objective concerned the implementation of a new customer satisfaction \nmeasure which was presented and detailed during a Board meeting. The Board considered \nthe objective set for this category to be attained 100%.\n\nThe second specific objective concerned the impact of the integration of Altran on the Group’s \nstrategy. The Board noted the launch of the strategy focusing on “Intelligent Industry”, the \nintegration in the Group’s organization of an Engineering and R&D business line, the update of \nsynergies expected from this acquisition and the breakdown of the Group’s strategy presented \nto the key managers of the Group and to the Board during the “Rencontres” gathering at the \nbeginning of October\xa02020. Given these achievements, the Board considered the objectives \nset for this category to be attained 100%. \n\n  \n\nThe third specific objective concerned the transition and the assumption of the ofice of Chief \nExecutive Oficer, which took place at the height of the pandemic crisis. Given this situation, \nthe Board placed special emphasis on the importance given to managing this crisis in the \ncontext of the transition and the assumption of duties. Based on discussions held by the \nLead Independent Director with Board members, the demonstrated capacity of the Group to \nensure service continuity for its customers, the almost immediate implementation of working \nfrom home for 95% of Group employees and, finally, the resilience of Group results in such an \nexceptional period, the Board considered the objective set to be largely attained.\n\nThe Board approved a weighted performance of 115% as per the table below:\n\nTarget \nobjective\n\nAttainment \nlevel\n\nWeighted \nattainmentObjective Min Max\n\nCSR strategy – diversity 0% 12.5% 25% 120% 15%\n\nCSR strategy – sustainable \ndevelopment 0% 12.5% 25% 160% 20%\n\nChange in the portfolio 0% 25.0% 50% 120% 30%\n\nCustomer satisfaction 0% 12.5% 12.5% 100% 12,5%\n\nTransition and assumption of  \nthe duties of Chief Executive Oficer 0% 18.75% 18.75% 100% 18,75%\n\nImpact of Altran on the Group’s strategy 0% 18.75% 18.75% 100% 18,75%\n\nTotal 0% 50% 150% 115% 115%\n\nTarget amount (in €) 0 312,000 468,000\n\nProrated target amount (5/12) 0 130,000 195,000 130,000\n\nProposed amount(in €) 149,500\n\n  \n\n \n\n    \n\n\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE \nCompensation of corporate officers\n\n98 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n2.\n\nAmount or \naccounting value \nsubject to vote Presentation\n\n Accordingly, variable compensation of €262,236 was approved by the Board for 2020, i.e. \n67.2% of fixed compensation for the same fiscal year and 100,9% of the theoretical variable \ncompensation.

This allowance is subject to a performance condition based on the \nunflexed weighted performance of the V1 financial indicators.

It \nrepresents 50% of the total theoretical compensation if objectives are attained and is reviewed \nat long intervals in accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code. This amount was proposed following \nthe appointment of Mr. Aiman Ezzat as Chief Executive Oficer following the Shareholders’ \nMeeting of May\xa020, 2020. Furthermore, given the assumption of these duties during the year, \nthe compensation effectively paid in 2020 in respect of Mr. Aiman Ezzat’s duties was prorated \n7/12th, representing an amount of €583,333.\n\nAnnual variable \ncompensation\n\n€571,853  \n(paid in 2021  \nin respect  \nof 2020)\n\nDuring the Board of Directors’ meeting of March\xa018, 2021, the Board, based on the audited and \napproved accounts and at the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, assessed \nthe amount of Mr. Aiman Ezzat’s variable compensation for fiscal year 2020, of a full-year \ntarget amount if objectives are attained of €1,000,000, i.e. 50% of his theoretical fixed and \nvariable compensation or 50% of his fixed compensation and comprising financial objectives \nfor 60% and quantifiable and qualitative objectives for 40%, potentially varying between \n0% and 200% of the theoretical amount for quantifiable objectives and 0% and 100% of the \ntheoretical amount for purely qualitative objectives. Furthermore, given the assumption of \nthese duties during the year, the variable compensation in respect of Mr. Aiman Ezzat’s duties \nwas calculated based on 7/12th\xa0of the theoretical amount, that is €583,333.\n\nVariable component based on financial indicators: this component was calculated in \naccordance with quantifiable criteria and the following respective weightings, all relating to \nthe financial results as compared to objectives set by the Board at the beginning of the year, \nwhich remained unchanged despite the health crisis related to the Covid‑19 pandemic:\n\n1)  % attainment of revenues: 30% weighting; \n2)  % attainment of the operating margin rate: 30% weighting; \n3)  % attainment of pre-tax net profit: 20% weighting; \n4)   % attainment of free cash flow: 20% weighting.\n\nThese objectives were assessed with respect to the objectives set by the Board of Directors’ \nmeeting of March\xa011, 2020.\n\n  Attainment rates for these four objectives were 93.2%, 90.9%, 101.4% and 105.8% respectively, \nwhich, taking account of the relative weighting of each objective, gives a weighted attainment \nrate of 96.68%.\n\nThe Group’s historical calculation formula accelerates actual performance upwards or downwards \nsuch that for 2020:\n\n—  if the weighted performance of the above four financial indicators is less than or equal to \n75%, the V1 component will be nil; \n\n—  if the weighted performance of the above four financial indicators is greater than or equal \nto 125%, the V1 component will be capped and equal to twice its theoretical amount; \n\n—  accordingly, a one-point variance in the weighted attainment rate increases or decreases \nthe variable component by 4%; \n\n—  a weighted rate of 96.68% in 2020 results in the multiplication of the theoretical variable \ncomponent by 86.72%.\n\n—  for a final amount for the variable component calculated based on financial indicators of \n1,000,000 x 60% x 7/12 x 86.72% equal to €303,520\xa0euros\n\n  Variable component based on individual performance objectives: the assessment and \nassociated proposal were based on work performed by the Compensation Committee, \nwhich reviewed the various individual performance objectives grouped into two categories: \n“quantifiable objectives” for 50% and “individual performance objectives” for 50%. It is recalled \nthat as part of the announced change in the Group’s governance with the transition by Mr. \nAiman Ezzat from Chief Operating Oficer to Chief Executive Oficer from the Shareholders’ \nMeeting of May\xa02020, the Board set objectives on an annual basis with the same objectives for \nthe holder of both the aforementioned ofices. The quantifiable objectives set by the Board \nat the beginning of the year remained unchanged.\n\n\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE \nCompensation of corporate officers\n\nCAPGEMINI 103\n\n2.\n\n \n\nAmount or \naccounting value \nsubject to vote Presentation\n\n  The first set of quantifiable objectives concerned growth in Digital and Cloud offers. Published \ngrowth exceeded 16% above the target set initially by the Board, which the Board considered \nto be a very good performance in the 2020 context of the pandemic. On this basis the Board \nassessed the attainment rate for the first set of quantifiable objectives to be 120%. \n\n  The second set of quantifiable objectives concerned the deployment of the CSR strategy focusing \non diversity and environmental responsibility. The diversity objective was measured based \non the % of women in key senior executive positions, with a 2-point improvement objective \nin 2020. This ambitious objective was attained and even slightly exceeded. With regards to \nenvironmental responsibility, the objective was a 5% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions/\nemployee during the fiscal year. This objective was largely exceeded mainly due to the marked \nreduction in business travel because of the health crisis tied to the Covid-19 pandemic. The \nBoard assessed the attainment rate for the second set of quantifiable objectives to be 140%.\n\nTherefore, given these achievements, the Board considered the objectives set for the quantifiable \ncomponent to be attained 130%.\n\nThe Board defined three specific individual performance objectives.\n\nThe first specific objective concerned the implementation of a new customer satisfaction \nmeasure which was presented and detailed during a Board meeting. The Board considered \nthe objective set for this category to be attained 100%. \n\n  \n\nThe second specific objective concerned the impact of the integration of Altran on the Group’s \nstrategy. The Board noted the launch of the strategy focusing on “Intelligent Industry”, the \nintegration in the Group’s organization of an Engineering and R&D business line, the update of \nsynergies expected from this acquisition and the breakdown of the Group’s strategy presented \nto the key managers of the Group and to the Board during the “Rencontres” gathering at the \nbeginning of October\xa02020. Given these achievements, the Board considered the objectives \nset for this category to be attained 100%.\n\nThe third specific objective concerned the transition and the assumption of the ofice of Chief \nExecutive Oficer, which took place at the height of the pandemic crisis. Given this situation, \nthe Board placed special emphasis on the importance given to managing this crisis in the \ncontext of the transition and the assumption of duties. Based on discussions held by the \nLead Independent Director with Board members, the demonstrated capacity of the Group to \nensure service continuity for its customers, the almost immediate implementation of working \nfrom home for 90% of Group employees and, finally, the resilience of Group results in such an \nexceptional period, the Board considered the objective set to be largely attained.\n\nThe Board approved a weighted performance of 115% as per the table below:\n\nTarget \nobjective\n\nAttainment \nlevel\n\nWeighted \nattainmentObjective Min Max\n\nCSR strategy – diversity 0% 12.5% 25% 120% 15%\n\nCSR strategy – sustainable \ndevelopment 0% 12.5% 25% 160% 20%\n\nChange in the portfolio 0% 25.0% 50% 120% 30%\n\nCustomer satisfaction 0% 12.5% 12.5% 100% 12,5%\n\nTransition and assumption of  \nthe duties of Chief Executive Oficer 0% 18.75% 18.75% 100% 18,75%\n\nImpact of Altran on the Group’s strategy 0% 18.75% 18.75% 100% 18,75%\n\nTotal 0% 50% 150% 115% 115%\n\nTarget amount (in €) 0 400,000 600,000\n\nProrated target amount (7/12) 0 233,333 350,000 233,333\n\nProposed amount (in €) 268,333\n\n  \n\n \n\n    \n\n\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE \nCompensation of corporate officers\n\n104 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n2.\n\nAmount or \naccounting value \nsubject to vote Presentation\n\n that is a variable component based on individual performance objectives of a prorated \namount of €1,000,000 x 40% x 7/12 = €233,333, to which the weighted performance \npercentage of 115% is applied, giving a final amount of €268,0333.\n\nAccordingly, variable compensation of €571,853 was approved by the Board for 2020, i.e. \n98.0% of fixed compensation for the same fiscal year and of the theoretical variable \ncompensation.

This allowance is subject to a performance condition based on the \nunflexed weighted performance of the V1 financial indicators. For 2020, this gives a weighted \nattainment of 96.68%%, giving an amount of 96.68% x €400,000 = €386,720 for a full year \nand €225,586 for 7\xa0months.\n\n—  50% of this amount, i.e. €112,793, will be paid in July\xa02021; \n—  50%, i.e. €112,793, will be paid in July\xa02022, subject to Mr. Aiman Ezzat being present in \n\nthe Group at June\xa030, 2022.\n\nStock options, \nperformance \nshares or any \nother form \nof long-term \ncompensation\n\nPerformance  \nshares  \n€1,980,116  \n(IFRS accounting \nvalue on grant  \ndate)\n\n25,000\xa0shares granted subject to performance and presence conditions.\n\nThe vesting of performance shares is contingent on the realization of both an external \nperformance condition and two internal performance conditions. The external performance \ncondition accounts for 35% of the grant and is based on the comparative performance of \nthe Capgemini share over three years against the average performance of a basket of eight \ncomparable companies in the same business sector and from at least five countries (Accenture/\nIndra/Atos/Tieto/Sopra Stéria/CGI Group/Infosys and Cognizant), the CAC\xa040 index and the \nEuro Stoxx Techno 600\xa0index. Accordingly, no shares vest if the relative performance of the \nCapgemini share is less than 100% of the performance of the basket of comparable companies, \nwhile 100% of shares vest only if this relative performance is at 110% or above. If performance \nis similar to that of the market, only 50% of the initial grant vests.\n\n \n\nThe external condition has been strengthened since 2016, as the effective vesting of shares \nstarts from a minimum achievement of 100% of the basket of comparable companies, while \nhistorically it started at 90%. The internal performance condition based on organic free cash \nflow generation over the three-year period from 2020 to 2022 accounts for 50% of the grant. \nThe minimum amount necessary for shares to vest is €3.4\xa0billion. Above this threshold, shares \nvest progressively on a straight-line basis, with the maximum grant requiring organic free cash \nflow of €3.7\xa0billion or more. The internal performance condition relating to CSR performance \nindicators measured at the end of 2022 is based for 50% on the percentage inflow of female \nexecutives (VPs) through promotion and external hiring during the period 2020 to 2022. This \npercentage must be 29% to receive 100% of the grant, with no grant if it is below 26.5%. For \nthe remaining 50%, it is based on a reduction in GhG emissions/employee of at least 10% vs. \nthe 2019 benchmark, with 100% of the grant vesting if this reduction reaches 15%.\n\nThe number of shares that may vest to Executive Corporate Oficers may not exceed 0.0012% \nof the share capital.\n\nAuthorized by the Combined Shareholders’ Meeting of May\xa020, 2020\nThirtieth resolution\nGrant authorized by the Board of Directors on October\xa07, 2020\n\nStock  \noptions = n/a  \nOther items = n/a\n\nNo stock options or other items were granted.\n\nCompensation \nfor duties as a \ndirector\n\nN/A N/A\n\nValuation of \nbenefits in kind\n\n€0 No company car\n\n\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE \nCompensation of corporate officers\n\n106 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n2.\n\nOther compensation components\n\n \nAmount subject to \nvote Presentation\n\nSeverance pay €0 No amount due in respect of the fiscal year\n\nFollowing the appointment of Mr. Aiman Ezzat as Chief Operating Oficer as of January\xa01, 2018, \nthe Board, based on the proposal of the Compensation Committee, authorized the principle \nof severance pay due in the event of termination of his corporate ofice. During the meeting \nof March\xa011, 2020, the Board of Directors considered that it was in the Company’s interest to \nmaintain this system for the Chief Executive Oficer in the event of forced departure. however, \nno severance pay shall be due if the Chief Executive Oficer leaves the Company on his own \ninitiative, changes positions within the Group, is entitled to exercise his right to retire in the \nnear future or is 65\xa0years old on the termination of his term of ofice, or in the event of a gross \nnegligence or serious misconduct.\n\nIn compliance with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, the aggregate amount of \n(i)\xa0severance pay effectively paid, and (ii)\xa0any indemnity likely to be paid in consideration for \nthe non-compete undertaking, may not exceed a maximum amount equal to twice the fixed \ncompensation plus theoretical annual variable compensation as at the date of termination \nof his duties.\n\nThe grant and amount of the severance pay will depend on the percentage attainment of \nthe weighted performance of the financial indicators applicable for the Chief Executive \nOficer’s variable component based on financial performance observed annually during the \ntwo completed fiscal years preceding the termination of his duties as Chief Executive Oficer, \nit being specified that the final year will count for 60%, while the previous year will count for \n40%.

This plan was reviewed by an external firm which confirmed that \nit complies with the AFEP-MEDEF recommendations of October\xa06, 2009, and also the revised \nAFEP-MEDEF Governance Code.\n\nThe plan was closed to new beneficiaries in 2015 and rights of existing members have been \nfrozen as of October 31, 2015.\n\nIn order to receive benefits under this plan, it is necessary to be with the Group at the time of \nretirement, to have at least 10\xa0years of seniority, to have been a Group Executive Committee \nmember for at least five years and to have a compensation level above eight times the French \nannual social security ceiling (PASS) during five years at least.\n\nBenefits are based on reference earnings equal to the average of the three best years (fixed \nand variable components) from among the ten years preceding retirement.\n\nIn addition, this supplementary pension is subject to three cumulative limits such that the \npension amount cannot exceed:\n\n—  40% of reference earnings; \n— 5 0% of reference earnings, including pensions received under all other pension plans; and\n—  reference earnings are capped at 60\xa0times the French annual social security ceiling.\n\n\n\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE \nCompensation of corporate officers\n\nCAPGEMINI 109\n\n2.\n\n \nAmount  \nsubject to vote Presentation\n\n  Benefits are proportional to length of service (minimum of 10\xa0years required and a maximum \nof 30\xa0years), reflecting the required progressive acquisition of entitlement, which remains \nwell below the threshold set by the AFEP-MEDEF Code and the recent legal ceiling of 3% per \nannum. Entitlement is acquired at a rate of 1.5% per year for the first 10\xa0years of seniority and \nfor subsequent years only at rates of:\n\n—  1% up to 20\xa0times the French annual social security ceiling\n—  2% between 20 and 40\xa0times the French annual social security ceiling\n—  3% between 40 and 60\xa0times the French annual social security ceiling\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible annual entitlement is equal to 1.83% before the potential \nimpact of the cumulative limits. Due to the long seniority of our Chairman and Chief Executive \nOficer (frozen at 23\xa0years in 2015), the value of the annual pension is estimated at a net \namount after income tax and employee social contributions of K€296, corresponding to a \ngross amount of K€887 or 34% of his last theoretical compensation for his duties as Chairman \nand Chief Executive Oficer.\n\nThe plan is financed through an external insurance company and as such the required funds \nto pay the pension support a contribution of 24%.\n\nTwenty-one members have benefited from this plan since its launch with seven presently \nactive at December\xa031, 2020.\nPresented to the Combined Shareholders’ Meeting of April\xa026, 2007\nFourth resolution in respect of regulated agreements.\n\nEmployment contract of Executive Corporate Officers\n\nWith regards to Mr. Paul hermelin, the Board reminds readers \nthat his employment contract was suspended in its entirety on \nMay\xa024, 1996 (date from which he exercised his first term of ofice \nas a member of the Management Board) and that he informed the \nBoard of Directors’ meeting of February\xa018, 2015 that he waived \nhis employment contract as from that date.\n\nMr. Aiman Ezzat’s employment contract was suspended following \nhis appointment as Chief Operating Oficer on January\xa01, 2018, \nwhen he became an Executive Corporate Oficer of the Group. In \naddition, he informed the Board of Directors’ meeting of March\xa011, \n2020 of his decision to waive his employment contract from his \nappointment as Chief Executive Oficer.

The scope adopted by the Group encompasses \nFrench companies of the economic and social unit to which has \nbeen added this year, following the acquisition of Altran at the \nbeginning of 2020, all Altran French legal entities. France, which \nis the Group’s home country and the second largest country in \nsize, was considered the natural reference scope for calculating \nthese ratios, with the Group holding company and over half the \nGroup Executive Board members also based in France. The scope \nconsidered therefore includes over 99.9% of the French legal \nentities workforce.\n\nMethodology\n\nThe calculations were performed in accordance with AFEP \nguidelines and include all compensation components paid during \nthe relevant year, both in the numerator and in the denominator \n(fixed, variable, exceptional and deferred compensation, benefits in \nkind, profit-sharing, incentive payments, social contributions,\xa0etc.), \nas well as the IFRS valuation of shares granted during the relevant \nyear and for the Executive Corporate Directors, the long savings \nplan granted for the year if any. The denominator includes active \nemployees present throughout the relevant year, on a full-time \nequivalent basis.

systems\n\nThis Section was drafted jointly by several Group stakeholders. The \ndepartments that play a key role in identifying and controlling major \nrisks include particularly the Internal Audit, Ethics, Compliance, \nFinance, Risk & Insurance, Legal, human Resources and Security \n& Mobility Departments.\n\nIn accordance with the Law of July\xa03, 2008, this Section was \nreviewed and approved by the Board of Directors on February\xa017, \n2021, following a review by the Audit & Risk Committee.\n\n3.1.1  Definition of the internal control and risk management systems\n\na)  Framework\n\nThe Group builds on the reference framework and the application \nguidance published initially in January\xa02007 and updated on July\xa022, \n2010 by the French Financial Markets Authority (AMF).\n\nThe risk management and internal control systems contribute to \ncontrolling the activities of the Group and satisfy complementary \nobjectives.\n\nb)  Objectives of the internal control and risk \nmanagement systems\n\nThe Group’s internal control and risk management systems seek \nto create and protect the Group’s value, assets and reputation, \nand identify and measure the major risks to which the Group is \nexposed, anticipate and foresee changes in these risks and finally \nimplement risk prevention and transfer measures.\n\nIn this context, Capgemini group has defined and implemented a \ncontrol system that seeks to ensure:\n\n—  compliance of all management acts with relevant laws and \nregulations; \n\n—  compliance with the Group’s seven core values and guidelines \nset by the Board of Directors and/or Group Management; \n\n—  application by the subsidiaries of instructions communicated; \n—  the smooth functioning of the Group’s internal control \n\nprocesses safeguarding assets; and\n—  the reliability of accounting and financial information.\n\nc)  Scope of the internal control and risk \nmanagement systems\n\nCapgemini ensures the implementation of risk management and \ninternal control systems covering all consolidated subsidiaries and \nGroup businesses in 2020.\n\nAcquired companies are integrated progressively into the internal \ncontrol and risk management systems. All material Group subsidiaries \nare currently integrated into the general system presented in \nthis report.\n\nd)  Limitations\n\nWhile contributing to the improved eficiency of its operational \nsupport functions, the optimal use of resources and good risk \ncontrol, this system does not however offer an absolute guarantee \nof the control of all possible risks imaginable, no more than it can – \nirrespective of the skills of the employees performing the controls \n– guarantee alone the attainment by the Group of all objectives set.\n\ne)  Organization of the internal control and risk \nmanagement systems\n\nGroup values\n\nSince its creation, Capgemini has placed significant importance on \ncompliance with the values and principles which guide and inspire \n\nits actions and, in particular, its business practices. These seven \ncore values, defined by the Group‘s founder Mr. Serge Kampf, are \nhonesty, boldness, trust, freedom, fun, modesty and team spirit. \nThey represent the Group‘s fundamental DNA and justify its \nreputation as an ethical and responsible company. In this respect, \nCapgemini has, for several years, been rated one of the “World’s \nMost Ethical Companies” by the Ethisphere Institute.\n\nThe ethics system founded on the Group’s values and the Code of \nBusiness Ethics has been supplemented by several policies. This \nsystem seeks to:\n\n— d evelop within new recruits an ethical culture promoting \nintegrity of behavior; \n\n—  raise awareness of compliance with international and \nnational laws and regulations; \n\n—  implement initiatives aimed at strengthening the system \nto prevent and avoid infractions, non-compliance and \nnegligence in these areas.\n\nGeneral internal control and risk management \nprinciples\n\nGroup Management has discussed, drafted, approved and distributed \na set of rules and procedures known as the Blue Book. Compliance \nwith the Blue Book is mandatory for all Group employees. The \nBlue Book sets out and comments Capgemini‘s seven core values, \nsketches out the overall security framework within which the \nGroup‘s activities must be conducted, and, finally, describes the \ndesired behaviors and specifies the prohibitions applicable in each \nof the Group‘s main functions.\n\nThese principles ensure consistent, eficient and accountable \ndecision-making. They concern:\n\n—  delegation of decision-making powers and authorization; the \ndecision-making process applied within the Group is based \non rules governing the delegation of powers. These rules are \nregularly updated, comply with the principle of subsidiarity \nand define three levels of decision-making depending on \nthe issues involved, corresponding to the three levels of \nCapgemini’s organization:\n\n–  the Business Unit, for all issues that fall within its remit,\n–  provisions common to the Strategic Business Unit (SBU) \n\nand to the Global Business Line (GBL) for all issues \nconcerning several Business Units and Business Lines \nunder its authority; \n\n–  the Group (Group Management, Group Executive Board, \nExecutive Committee, central functions, etc.) where \na decision concerns a wider scope than the Strategic \nBusiness Unit and for all transactions that must be \ndecided at Group level due to their nature (acquisitions, \ndivestments, etc.) and/or transactions with financial \nimpacts in excess of well-defined materiality thresholds.\n\n\n\nRISKS AND INTERNAL CONTROL \nInternal control and risk management systems\n\nCAPGEMINI 121\n\n3.\n\nThis process has been formalized in an “authorization matrix” \nwhich requires both prior consultation and the provision of \nsuficient information to the parties involved. Recommendations \nsubmitted to the final decision-maker must include the views of \nall interested parties as well as an assessment of the advantages \nand drawbacks of each of the possible solutions.\n\n—  the framework of general policies and procedures; the Blue \nBook defines the governance and organization of the Group \nand the main principles and basic guidelines underpinning \nthe Group’s internal control procedures, and sets out the \nGroup’s requirements in each of the following areas:\n\n–  Group key principles,\n–  Group organization and governance,\n– a uthorization and approval processes,\n–  sales and production rules and guidelines,\n–  risk management, pricing, contracting and legal rules, in \n\nthe client contract pre-sale phase,\n– fin ancial management, merger, acquisition, divestment \n\nand insurance rules and guidelines,\n–  human resources policies,\n– m arketing and communications, knowledge management \n\nand Group IT guidelines,\n–  procurement policies, including ethical requirements \n\nand supplier selection,\n–  environmental and community policies.\n\nThis set of “rules and procedures”, which has force of law within \nthe Group, reminds employees of their obligations in this area and \ninventories the tools and methods which help them control risks \nidentified in the exercise of the Group’s businesses.\n\nThese rules and procedures are updated periodically to reflect \nthe development of the Group‘s business activities and changes \nin its environment.\n\nRisk management and internal control stakeholders\n\nThe Group developed a risk management system administered by a \nRisk Committee and involving various parties operating at different \nlevels of the organization. These key players are presented below \nfor each of the three lines of defense.\n\nGovernance bodies\n\nThe Audit & Risk Committee\n\nThe Capgemini\xa0SE Board’s Audit & Risk Committee is responsible \nfor ensuring the existence and monitoring the eficiency of risk \nmanagement and internal control systems.\n\nThe Audit & Risk Committee is therefore required to review all \nsystems implemented by Group Management. These reviews cover:\n\n—  the overall consistency of the framework; \n—  verification that the major risks faced by the Group are \n\nidentified and monitored, particularly through a review \nof the risk mapping prepared and updated by the Group \nManagement Risk Committee; \n\n—  presentation of new or emerging risks; \n—  a review of projects comprising major risks.\n\nGroup Management and the Risk Committee\n\nGroup Management has delegated to a Risk Committee, created in \n2016, the definition and implementation of the various activities \nrelating to the risk management process within the Group. The \nRisk Committee, chaired by the Group Chief Financial Oficer and \ncoordinated by the Risk and Assurance Director, is responsible for \nthe effective implementation of a risk management and internal \ncontrol system within the Group. It reports to the Audit & Risk \nCommittee on all issues concerning these systems.\n\nThe Risk Committee brings together the main members of Group \nManagement with key players in the risk management process \nwithin the Group. At least two meetings are held annually to discuss \nthe following main issues:\n\n—  monitoring of the implementation of risk management and \ninternal control systems; \n\n— i dentification and prioritizing of risks; the Risk Committee \nvalidates the mapping of the Group’s critical risks; \n\n— mon itoring of plans defined and implemented for critical \nrisks; \n\n— t he review of new or emerging risks potentially communicated \nby the various Business Units.\n\nThe Risk Committee is also responsible for:\n\n—  making proposals to the Board of Directors on the Group’s \nacceptable risk level; \n\n—  monitoring changes in the Group’s main risks; \n—  selecting the critical risks to be covered by short-term action \n\nplans; \n—  monitoring these action plans in conjunction with the critical \n\nrisk owners, as designated by the Risk Committee; \n—  approving and implementing the risk management and \n\ninternal control policies.\n\nThe Risk Committee builds on the actions of the Risk and Insurance \nDirector, who is responsible for coordinating Group risk management \nand the managers of the various Business Units and functional \ndepartments.\n\nIn this respect, the risk management coordinator:\n\n—  makes methodology tools and approaches available to the \nvarious management bodies; \n\n—  coordinates all risk management activities within the Group; \n\n—  centralizes and consolidates all work and particularly work \nperformed by the various critical risk owners; \n\n—  encourages the sharing of good practices within the Group.\n\nThe risk management and internal control system comes from the \ninteraction between the Risk Committee and other stakeholders, \nincluding the Risk and Insurance Department, Internal Audit, the \nCompliance Department and the functional departments with risk \nexpertise, as well as the operating departments that are responsible \nfor day-to-day risk management in their specific areas.\n\n1st line of defense: from management to employees\n\nOperations and Business Unit management supplement and \nadapt the Blue Book drafted by Group Management, by drawing \nup detailed internal control procedures which comply with the \nrelevant laws, regulations and customary practices in the country \nwhere they operate, in order to exercise control more effectively \nover risks specific to their local market and culture.\n\nOperations and Business Unit management duties include the \nidentification and control of risks relating to their own environment, \nin compliance with the rules and procedures implemented and \ncommunicated by the Group functional departments.\n\n2nd line of defense: functional departments with risk \nexpertise\n\nThe various Group functional departments assist the Risk Committee \nwith the identification and ranking of risks. Each department defines \nand rolls out risk control systems in its activity sector and ensures, \nin particular, the consistency of actions undertaken in the Business \nUnits. It assists all Group entities by facilitating the sharing of risk \nmanagement and internal control best practice.\n\n\n\nRISKS AND INTERNAL CONTROL \nInternal control and risk management systems\n\n122 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n3.\n\n3rd line of defense: Internal Audit\n\nIn accordance with professional standards governing this activity, \nthe Internal Audit function independently assesses the effectiveness \nof internal control and risk management procedures given that, \nirrespective of how well they are drafted and how stringently \nthey are applied, these procedures can only provide reasonable \nassurance – and not an absolute guarantee – against all risks.\n\nInternal Audit is therefore tasked with:\n\n—  reviewing the internal control procedures implemented \nin the Strategic Business Units and their component legal \nentities to ensure that they comply with the general \nprinciples and rules laid down by the Group and with certain \nspecific procedures enabling the elimination or mitigation of \nthe risks to which they are exposed locally; \n\n—  auditing the Group’s major contracts considered to present \nsignificant risk.\n\nFor over 30\xa0years, the Capgemini group has had a central Internal \nAudit function. Its Director reports directly to the Chief Executive \nOficer, guaranteeing the internal audit function is independent of \nthe functions and Business Units audited. At the end of 2020, the \ninternal audit team comprised 33\xa0auditors (full time equivalent), \nrepresenting nine different nationalities and covering 91% \nof the languages spoken locally in the Group. This significant \ninternationalization of the internal audit team reflects the desire \nto accompany the expansion of the Group into new regions of \nthe world; the Internal Audit Department also has a Bombay desk \nwith 17\xa0auditors including five technical experts specializing in the \nreview of IT projects.\n\nEach Business Unit is audited in line with a bi-annual program \ncovering the entire Group. The Chief Executive Oficer has the \npower to modify this program in the event of an emergency (delays \nand irregularities, major divergence from budgetary commitments, \netc.). At the request of the Chief Executive Oficer, the Internal \nAudit Department may also perform special assignments to review \nspecific situations.\n\nIn 2020, the Internal Audit Department conducted 39\xa0audits of \nunits belonging to all Group Strategic Business Units; these audits \nwere conducted remotely due to the restrictive measures taken \nin response to the health crisis.\n\nEach audit involved an average of 68\xa0man-days. It concluded with \nthe issue of an action plan that management of the unit audited \nundertook to implement as quickly as possible in order to improve \nor correct the internal control weaknesses identified by the audit. \nThe Internal Audit Department uses a tool covering the entire \nGroup and enabling it to monitor real-time the implementation of \naction plans defined by local management following audits. Close \nattention is paid to actions plans considered a priority.\n\nIn 2020 the audit approach was strengthened by integrating critical \nrisks presented in the risk mapping identified by Group Management.\n\nThe Internal Audit Director presents twice annually to the Capgemini\xa0SE \nBoard’s Audit & Risk Committee, a comprehensive report on the \ndepartment’s work, particularly regarding the eficiency of internal \ncontrol and risk management in the preparation and processing \nof financial and accounting information.\n\n3.1.2  Implementation of risk management and internal control objectives \nfor the preparation and processing of financial and accounting \ninformation\n\nThese procedures ensure application of and compliance with \naccounting and financial rules defined by the Group relating to \nbudgets and forecasts, operational reporting, consolidation, \nfinancial control and financial communications.\n\nAs part of the integration process for Altran acquired in March\xa02020, \nthe Group defined an action plan to align its procedures during 2021.\n\na)  Financial and accounting structure\n\nThe Group’s financial functions are integrated into the operating \nstructure, that is, both Business Units and countries. They have \naccess to common resources encompassing accounting rules and \nprocedures, information and management systems and shared \nservice centers.\n\nEach Business Unit has a dedicated financial controller (reporting \nto the corresponding Strategic Business Unit’s financial controller) \nwho is responsible for ensuring that the results of its activities \nare accurately reported in the accounts in accordance with Group \naccounting rules and methods. The financial controller verifies that \nservices are correctly billed and paid, checks profit estimates for \nongoing projects and assesses their accounting impact, and attests \nto the quality of the information contained in the financial reports \nand accounting packages used as the basis for preparing the Group‘s \nconsolidated financial statements. The Strategic Business Unit \nfinancial controllers, whose main responsibility is to ensure that \nhigh-quality financial and accounting information is reported to \nthe parent company on a timely basis, report to the Group Chief \nFinancial Oficer in order to safeguard the independence required \nwhen preparing accounting results. Financial control is, therefore, \ndecentralized.\n\nThe countries and geographic areas have a Legal Financial Director, \nwhose duties and responsibilities include rolling-out Group systems \nand procedures in the country, helping maintain an effective \ninternal control environment, ensuring that all financial staff in \nthe country or region are well-versed in the Group‘s accounting \npolicies and methods, checking compliance with local taxation \nand statutory reporting requirements, liaising with shared service \ncenters and the Statutory auditors, setting accounts closing and \nfinancial reporting timetables, signing off on the consolidation \npackages of the subsidiaries under his or her authority, signing \nthe representation letter, jointly with the head of the Business \nUnit, and bringing any and all matters that he or she sees fit to \nthe attention of the Group Chief Financial Oficer.\n\nAll financial staff are required to apply the Group’s accounting \nprocedures and policies contained in the TransFORM manual, \nwhich sets out:\n\n—  the strict rules of internal control; \n—  what information must be reported, when, and how often; \n—  management rules and procedures; \n—  accounting policies, rules and methods; \n— p erformance measures.\n\nIn addition, the Group has a global integrated management system \n(GFS). The application as a whole migrated to the publisher’s \nlatest version on January\xa01, 2015 and its roll-out in the Group’s \nsubsidiaries continued during 2020. The desired uniformity of \nmanagement systems is therefore a step closer, strengthening \nthe control environment.\n\n\n\nRISKS AND INTERNAL CONTROL \nInternal control and risk management systems\n\nCAPGEMINI 123\n\n3.\n\nFinally, the shared service centers pool the accounting processing \nresources of the Group‘s subsidiaries. The main centers are located \nin Cracow (Poland) and Kolkata (India). These various centers are \nconsolidated within a globalized structure.\n\nb)  Budgets, forecasts, reporting and consolidation\n\nIn order to exercise effective control over their operations, the \nGroup requires Business Units to submit weekly, monthly, quarterly, \nhalf-yearly and annual reports of all budget, forecast, operational \nand accounting information required for the general management \nof the Group as follows:\n\n—  budget and forecasting process; budgets form the basic \nbuilding blocks in the management control process. They \nare debated and negotiated at length between the different \nGroup Business Unit managers and their superiors, with \neach budgetary item decided based on past performance, \nthe Group’s chosen strategic priorities and available \ninformation concerning expected market trends. Group \nManagement sets quantified targets for each geographic \narea, Strategic Business Unit and their component Business \nUnits. The budget preparation process is a key moment in \nthe relationship between the different levels of the Group’s \nmanagement and makes it possible to substantially link the \nvariable portion of the compensation paid to Business Unit \nmanagers to the attainment of the budgetary targets of \ntheir Business Unit and the next level Business Unit to which \nthey belong. A forecast operating Income Statement (for the \ncurrent month, the following six months and the full year) \nis prepared monthly by each Business Unit manager and any \ndifferences compared to budget are analyzed to immediately \ndecide any necessary action plans; \n\n— op erational reporting process; information reporting is \nmainly structured by geographic area and business. This \nallows revenues and costs to be analyzed on a monthly basis \nboth by type and function, and performance measures to \nbe updated and compared with budget (A/B), the latest \nforecasts (A/F) and prior-year figures (A/A’). A monthly \nmanagement report is prepared for each Strategic Business \nUnit jointly by the manager and financial controller and is \nsubmitted to Group Management for review. This report \ngives a detailed breakdown of actual performance, forecasts \nfor the following six months and actions taken in the event \nof material variances between actual and budget figures. \nReconciliations are performed systematically to ensure that \nfinancial information derived from the operational reporting \nsystem is consistent with the consolidated financial \ninformation provided by the legal entities within the Group; \n\n—  consolidation process; at each yearly or half-yearly closing, \nthe scope of consolidation is updated at Group level by the \nFinance Department and validated by the Legal Department. \nWritten instructions are issued providing the schedule \nfor period-end tasks (particularly the reconciliation of \ninter-company transaction balances), highlighting current \naccounting issues requiring specific attention, and describing \nthe control procedures applied during the preparation of the \nconsolidated financial statements. Each yearly and half-yearly \nclosing is preceded by a hard-close phase based on the \naccounts closed at November\xa030 and May\xa031, respectively.\n\nThe consolidation process is based on accounting packages by \ngeographic area, which must be signed off by the person responsible \nfor preparing them. Income statements, balance sheets and other \nkey management indicators required for subsequent analysis are \nstored in a single database maintained at Group level. Access to \nthis information system is strictly controlled.\n\nDuring each annual closing period, the Finance Department sends \nout a questionnaire to all subsidiaries covering the application of \ngeneral internal control principles and procedures relating to the \nprocessing of reported financial and accounting information. These \nquestionnaires are analyzed for any irregularities and corrective \nmeasures devised where appropriate.\n\nc)  Financial information \n\nFinancial information and its communication are subject to specific \ncontrols at half-year and annual period ends. These include:\n\n—  a systematic review carried out with the assistance of the \nLegal Department of all material operations and transactions \noccurring during the period; \n\n— a  procedure to identify, collate and report off-balance sheet \ncommitments and any other information liable to have \nsignificant repercussions on the financial position of the \nGroup or one of its subsidiaries at the period-end; \n\n—  a review of the tax position of each of the Group’s legal \nentities; \n\n—  a review of the value of intangible assets; \n\n—  a detailed analysis of the statement of cash flows.\n\nThe controls described above and carried out by the Finance \nDepartment are supplemented by the work of two independent \nbodies tasked with carrying out checks on the internal control \nenvironment and verifying the quality of the financial statements: \nthe internal auditors and the Statutory auditors:\n\n—  Internal Audit; based on a program covering the Group’s \nBusiness Units, drawn up in agreement with the Chief \nExecutive Oficer (to who it reports directly), Internal \nAudit is responsible for carrying out controls to ensure \nthat procedures relating to the safeguarding of assets, the \nvaluation of work-in-progress, the actual amount of trade \naccounts receivable, and the proper recognition of liabilities, \nare applied in each Business Unit in accordance with the \nrules and methods established by the Group. In particular, \nInternal Audit is required to pay special attention to revenue \nrecognition methods and to controlling the percentage \nof completion of projects, so as to ensure that these are \naccounted for on the basis of rigorous, up-to-date technical \nassessments. The Internal Audit brief also includes a review \nof the procedures and controls in place within the Business \nUnit to ensure the security and validity of transactions and \naccounting entries; \n\n—  the Statutory auditors, who it need merely be noted here, \ncarry out an ongoing review of internal control procedures \nwith an impact on the preparation and quality of the financial \nstatements as part of their audit engagement.\n\nCommunicating financial information is subject to rigorous internal \ncontrol, with a particular focus on three key media used to report \nfinancial information:\n\n—  the half-Year Financial Report, the Annual Report and the \nUniversal Registration Document; \n\n—  financial press releases; \n—  analyst and investor meetings.\n\nThe financial reports and Universal Registration Document comprise \nall the information that must be provided pursuant to legal and \nregulatory requirements and are drawn up under the responsibility \nof the Finance Department.\n\n\n\nRISKS AND INTERNAL CONTROL \nInternal control and risk management systems\n\n124 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n3.\n\nFinancial press releases are only published further to formal \nvalidation of the Board of Directors or the Chief Executive Oficer. \nFinancial press releases are published outside the trading hours \nof the Paris Stock Exchange, except in exceptional circumstances.\n\nAnalyst and investor meetings are subject to specific preparation, \nand their content is presented to the Board of Directors prior to \nsuch meetings. This preparatory work is then used as a framework \nfor comments and explanations provided by the Chief Executive \nOficer, the Chief Financial Oficer, or employees in charge of \ninvestor relations during the meetings.\n\n3.1.3  Ethics & Compliance\n\nSince 1967, Capgemini’s success is founded on its core values, \nincluding honesty and trust. These values lead the Group to \nconstantly strengthen its ethical culture and compliance approach, \nboth within the organization and vis-à-vis third parties.\n\nIn 2020, for the eighth year running, Capgemini was recognized as \nOne of the World’s Most Ethical Companies by the Ethisphere Institute. \nThis recognition is awarded to companies that adopt long-term \nresponsible strategies and play a key role in driving positive change \nin business practices and civil society internationally.\n\nEthics & Compliance\n\nThe Group Ethics & Compliance program was launched in 2009 by \nthe Capgemini\xa0SE Board of Directors. Founded on our values, it is \nessential to the success of a diversified and decentralized group \nlike ours, with multi-cultural teams operating in nearly 50\xa0countries.\n\nOur seven core values (honesty, Boldness, Trust, Freedom, Team \nSpirit, Modesty and Fun) determine the guiding principles that \nwe stand for. They are described in greater detail in Section\xa01.1.2.\n\nOur Ethics program is founded on our ethics culture and underpins \nour Compliance program.\n\nThe Group’s Compliance program mainly covers: the fight against \ncorruption and money laundering, duty of care and human rights, \ncompetition, sanctions and embargos as well as data privacy.\n\nSee Section\xa04.2 (Ethics & Compliance) for further information on \nthe implementation of the Group’s Ethics and Compliance programs \nin 2020 and Section\xa04.3 (Duty of care) for further information on \nour actions concerning duty of care and human rights.\n\nEthics and Compliance governance bodies\n\nBoard of Directors\n\nA Code of Business Ethics was drafted in 2009 at the initiative of \nthe Capgemini Board of Directors. Each of the directors signed the \ninitial Code and the most recent update in 2019, evidencing their \ncommitment and support (both individual and collective) for all \nthe measures contained therein.\n\nAs early as 2006, the Capgemini Board of Directors set up an Ethics \n& Governance Committee whose main duty is to verify that the \nGroup’s seven core values are correctly applied and adhered to, \ndefended and promoted by the Group’s corporate oficers, senior \nmanagement and employees. It also ensures the implementation \nof a corruption and influence peddling prevention and detection \nsystem and oversees Group compliance with rules and conventions \non human rights and fundamental freedoms in the exercise of its \nactivities.\n\nThe implementation of the Group’s anti-corruption program is \npresented annually to the Ethics & Governance Committee since \n2018. The Group’s duty of care plan, developed in the context of \nFrench legal provisions on the duty of care, was presented to the \nEthics & Governance Committee on its adoption in 2018.\n\nOnce annually, the Ethics and Internal Audit Director reports to \nthe Ethics & Governance Committee on actions taken under the \nEthics program, alerts reported to the SpeakUp helpline and the \nvarious internal training and communication initiatives during the \nyear. As the Internal Audit Director, he also presents the results \nof compliance audits of the Group’s Code of Business Ethics, \nencompassing specific controls on compliance with the Sapin 2\xa0law \nin France which strengthened the anti-corruption framework.\n\nThe Board of Directors Audit & Risk Committee confirms that \nthe major risks to which the Group is exposed, such as financial, \nlegal, operational, social and environmental risks, are identified, \nmanaged and brought to its attention. It monitors the roll-out of \nappropriate internal control and risk management systems; to this \nend, it can draw on work performed by the Ethics & Governance \nCommittee during the course of its duties on preventing ethics \nand compliance risks.\n\nThe Chairman of the Ethics & Governance Committee and the \nChairman of the Audit & Risk Committee report on their respective \nwork to the Board of Directors at least once annually.\n\nSee Section\xa02.2.4 for a description of the work of the Board of \nDirectors’ Specialized committees in 2020.\n\nGroup Management\n\nA Compliance Oficer, reporting to the Group General Secretary, \nwas appointed at the end of 2020 to facilitate the Compliance \nprogram. he is responsible for the Group’s actions in the fight \nagainst corruption and money laundering and with respect to \nthe duty of care and human rights. he also ensures the Group’s \ncompliance with French legal requirements regarding the Statement \non Non-financial performance. The Group General Counsel remains \nresponsible for the implementation of Group actions concerning \ncompetition, sanctions and embargoes as well as data privacy. The \nduties of the Compliance Oficer were previously exercised by the \nEthics, Compliance and Internal Audit Director.\n\nSee Section\xa04.2.2 for further information on the Compliance \nprogram and particularly the Group’s anti-corruption and data \nprotection actions in 2020, as well as a description of the specific \ndata protection governance system.\n\nThe Ethics Oficer is responsible for the Ethics program across the \nentire Group and reports to the Group Chief Executive Oficer. \nFurther information on the implementation of the Ethics program \nin 2020 is presented in Section\xa04.2.1.\n\nFinally, the Ethics, Compliance, Legal and Internal Audit Departments \nmay at any moment draw up a special report for presentation to \nthe Chief Executive Oficer on any matter they consider should be \nbrought to his attention and inform the Audit & Risk Committee \nand/or the Ethics & Governance Committee where significant \ndeviations have been identified.\n\nBusiness Units – Global network\n\nThe managers of the Group’s operating units (SBUs/BUs) are \naccountable for ethics and compliance in their respective units. \nThey are also responsible for driving the Ethics & Compliance \nprograms in line with local legislation, regulations and procedures.\n\n\n\nRISKS AND INTERNAL CONTROL \nInternal control and risk management systems\n\nCAPGEMINI 125\n\n3.\n\nThe General Counsels of the Business Units report to the Group \nGeneral Counsel and also serve as Ethics & Compliance Oficers \nin their jurisdictions. They ensure implementation of the Ethics \n\n& Compliance programs within their regions and liaise with the \nEthics Oficer and the Group Compliance Oficer.\n\n3.1.4  Measures implemented as part of constant improvements to risk \nmanagement and internal control systems\n\na)  Focus on the main measures implemented in 2020\n\nDuring 2020, the Group implemented and continued to deploy a \nnumber of measures aimed at rolling-out and standardizing processes \nand procedures within the Group that will strengthen the control \nenvironment and enhance risk management within Capgemini. \nAmong these measures, the following may be highlighted:\n\n—  internal communication of the Group risk management \npolicy;

\n\n—  further strengthen personal data protection and IT security \nrisk management procedures.\n\n3.2  Risk analysis\n\nCovid-19\n\nFrom the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic crisis, the Group \nimplemented prevention and protection measures covering all \nemployees and stakeholders and constantly ensured compliance with \ndecisions and recommendations issued by local public authorities. \nIn addition, the Group continued to implement business continuity \nplans eficiently drafted and deployed in 2020 to maintain the \nquality of services delivered to clients.\n\nThe special management unit tasked with monitoring crisis \nmanagement decisions reports directly to the Group Executive \nCommittee. This unit implemented a series of Group instructions, \nprotocols and processes, that are adapted in line with pandemic \ndevelopments to manage the crisis on two fronts:\n\nEMPLOYEE SAFETY with the implementation of the following \nmeasures:\n\n—  ban on all but essential travel; \n—  ban on international meetings; \n—  postponement and cancellation of planned events; \n—  information campaign on preventive measures and hygiene \n\nprecautions; \n—  placing of at-risk employees in “14-day self-isolation”; \n—  site supplies: anti-bacterial hand wash, masks, temperature \n\nreaders; \n—  filtering of visitors; \n—  set-up of a psychological support program; \n—  implementation of a site cleaning and disinfection program.\n—  implementation of a vaccination campaign monitoring unit \n\ntaking account of prevailing rules in different countries.\n\nBUSINESS CONTINUITY with the massive roll-out of systematic \nhome working in all countries impacted by the pandemic and the \nintroduction of operational rotation for the engagements that \nmust be conducted on-site.\n\nThe Group has already adopted distributed delivery models for a \nnumber of years, supported by several sites spread around the world \nand using cutting-edge digital and on-line collaborative working \ntools. home working has therefore been widely deployed across \nthe whole Group, in agreement with our clients, to guarantee the \nbusiness continuity and the safety of our employees. An extremely \nlimited number of activities which, due to their nature, cannot be \nperformed remotely, are conducted on an individual case basis by \nrotating teams, with the appropriate health and Safety measures \nimplemented.\n\nThanks to good planning and rapid execution, capitalizing on \ninternal investment in these technologies, Capgemini enjoys one \nof the most extensive rates of home working in this sector, across \nall its activities worldwide.\n\nThe Covid-19 unit meets regularly and coordinates with local units \nin each of the countries where the Group is present. It ensures \nthe application of Group rules, the consistency of communication \ninside and outside the Group and regularly informs the Executive \nCommittee on the situation.\n\nAt this stage, the Group considers that it is in a position, notably \nthanks to its digital capabilities, to ensure the continuity of all the \nservices currently requested by its clients. Nonetheless, future \ndevelopments in the coronavirus pandemic and uncertainties as \nto its duration could very significantly increase the level of risk \nassociated with the environment in which the Group operates.\n\nBeyond these aspects and more broadly, the Covid-19 global \npandemic impacted a certain number of risks. These impacts were \ntaken into account when updating the mapping. Therefore, for each \nrisk identified, the repercussions of Covid-19 were considered in \norder to analyze their influence on the impact of the risk and/or \nits probability of occurring.\n\n3.2.1 Risk factors \n\nThe analysis of the risks to which the Group’s activities are exposed \nis an integral part of the Group’s various decision-making processes, \nwhether for short-term annual plans or mid-term strategic plans.\n\nIn this context, the Group has implemented a systematic and \ndynamic risk management process in order to ensure the proper \nconduct of business and the attainment of the various strategic \nobjectives, structured around four key stages – identification, \nprioritizing, processing and steering.\n\nThe Group has an up-to-date and consolidated overview of its \nkey risk exposures, including emerging risks, thanks to the risk \nmapping exercise and has defined a specific risk strategy for each \nrisk considered critical.\n\nThe different risks are presented below by category and decreasing \norder of criticality (reflecting a combination of the estimated \nimpact and potential probability) within each of these categories:\n\n\n\nRISKS AND INTERNAL CONTROL \nRisk analysis\n\nCAPGEMINI 127\n\n3.\n\n—  strategy and market risks; \n—  operational risks;\n—  security risks; \n—  legal and regulatory risks; \n—  human Resource risks; \n—  reputation risks;\n—  financial risks. Financial risks are presented but were not \n\nidentified as critical for the Group in 2020.\n\n  \n\n  \n\nThis year, attention was specifically focused on identifying risks \nassociated with Altran’s risk universe in the context of its integration, \nas well as issues relating to the Group’s Corporate, Social and \nEnvironmental Responsibility.\n\nThe assessment is made on the basis of net risk (after taking into \naccount risk management measures implemented).\n\nDeclaration of Non-Financial Performance  (DPEF ) risks are indicated \nby an asterisk below.\n\na)  Identification of risks\n\nCapgemini updated the mapping of its major risks at the end of \n2020, during which it assessed the risks likely to have a significant \nnegative impact on its activity, financial position or results. This \nanalysis focused on risks identified in 2019 while integrating risks \nspecific to Altran and seeking to identify new emerging risks. \nAccordingly, Corporate, Social and Environmental Responsibility \nrisks, such as risks relating to the environment and diversity, were \nincluded in the risk register for assessment.\n\nAs indicated above, the Covid-19 pandemic was taken into account \nfor each risk identified when assessing its impact and probability \nof occurrence. The risks presented below are the result of this \nanalysis work.\n\nIt remains possible that changes in economic conditions or the \nlegal environment could give rise to certain risks not currently \nidentified as material that could impact the results of the Group, \nits objectives, reputation or the share price.\n\nNote that no new critical risks were identified by the 2020 review.\n\nb)  Strategy and market risks\n\nMarket downturn\n\nRisk factors\n\nDevelopments in the coronavirus pandemic and uncertainties as \nto its duration are aggravating factors that could increase the \nrisk of a slowdown in the market impacting the environment in \nwhich the Group operates. The effects of this crisis could be felt \nat several levels.\n\nBroadly speaking, a major crisis impacting the financial markets or \nunfavorable trends in macro-economic indicators could potentially \nrestrict the Group’s ability to attain its objectives and continue its \ndevelopment.\n\nThe Group’s growth and financial results may be adversely affected \nby a general downturn in the service markets in which the Group \noperates or in one of Capgemini’s other key client business segment \n(such as Financial Services, banking and insurance), or by the effects \nof the pandemic on certain sectors (such as the aerospace and \nautomobile sectors).\n\nThe general economic context and more precisely restrictions \naffecting public bodies in the various countries subject to budgetary \nefforts, may weigh on the Group’s revenues and operating margin. \nA continued slowdown in the activity of certain economic sectors \nin which our clients operate would also limit their ability to invest \nand accordingly impact the results of the Group.\n\nConversely, a period of slowdown in one or more key Group markets \ncould offer opportunities, such as accelerating digitalization or \nthe customer experience by retailers, cost reductions by financial \ninstitutions through digitalizing key processes, or the use of \ntechnologies by the public sector in its long-term response to the \npandemic. In addition, societal and legislative pressure in favor of \ndecarbonization will probably accelerate, amongst other things, \nthe development and adoption of smart electric vehicles creating \ndemand for digital engineering and related services. The possibility \nof a business downturn, whether global or regional, increases with \ngeopolitical tension in different areas of the world (e.g. protectionist \nmeasures, multilateral trade tensions, or persistent uncertainties \naround certain aspects of Brexit, such as Financial Services). Each \nof these impacts, as well as other impacts not anticipated by the \nGroup, could have a negative impact on its activities, operating \nperformance, financial position and cash flow generation.\n\nRisk management systems\n\nThe crisis management plan drafted in 2019 to manage the effects \nof a major crisis generating a slowdown in the global market and \nthe Group’s expansion, largely contributed to its resilience during \nthe Covid-19 pandemic crisis.\n\nThe Group monitors and anticipates, as far as possible, macroeconomic \ndevelopments at global level, by closely monitoring company \ntrends in the markets where it operates, as well as analyzing the \npotential impacts of these changes on its own businesses and \nthose of its clients.\n\nWhile a substantial proportion of the Group’s operations depends \non its clients’ investment capacity, the fact that the Group is \norganized around medium-sized Business Units close to their \ntarget market allows for rapid responsiveness to changes in the \nbusiness environment.\n\nThe Group regularly monitors Brexit developments, so as to take \nappropriate measures to mitigate these risks based on decisions \ntaken by the relevant countries and the European Union.\n\nCountry risks, political violence and natural \ndisasters*\n\nRisk factors\n\nCapgemini has permanent operations in approximately 40\xa0countries. \nThe bulk of its revenues are generated in Europe and North \nAmerica, which are relatively economically and politically stable. Its \nRightshore® production model involves transferring production of \npart of the Group’s services to sites or countries other than those \nin which the services are used or in which the Group’s clients are \nlocated and particularly India (which alone accounts for over 50% \nof the Group headcount), Poland, China, Guatemala, Morocco \nand other Asian and Latin America countries. This operating \nmethod may increase the risk of business interruption at a given \nproduction site following a natural disaster, the likely occurrence \nof which rises with climate change, or due to an incident making \nit dificult or impossible to access telecommunication networks. \nPolitical violence in a country or region, or a geopolitical crisis \nsimultaneously impacting several Business Units could be a source \nof risk for the Group’s performance and reputation.\n\nThe risk of a pandemic crisis increases the Group’s exposure.\n\n\n\nRISKS AND INTERNAL CONTROL \nRisk analysis\n\n128 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n3.\n\nRisk management systems\n\nThe Group has implemented rigorous monitoring of its major \nclients with the aim of identifying, as early as possible, the faintest \nof signals from the markets where it operates and more directly \nfrom its clients, certain of which are more exposed than others \nto certain risks, such as geopolitical risks.\n\nIn response to the global health crisis, the Group eficiently moved \nall its delivery centers to working from home to ensure service \ncontinuity for clients.\n\nIn addition, beyond the global health crisis, the use of a large number \nof delivery centers across the globe reduces business interruption \nrisk by favoring backup solutions. Production systems and services \nprovided by the Group to its subsidiaries are duplicated and covered \nby back-up plans that are tested periodically. For example, in the \nsame way as other Group entities, the Group’s Indian subsidiary has \nset-up a Business Continuity Management (BCM) structure, that \nensures service continuity using ISO\xa022301\xa0compliant measures. \nThis has allowed it to launch the ISO\xa022301\xa0certification process \nat all Indian sites.\n\nTelecommunications networks used by the Group are duplicated \nin cases where offshore production resources are deployed. In the \nevent of a breakdown in the preferred (fastest) communications \nnetwork between Europe and India, service continuity is ensured \nby tried and tested alternative routes.\n\nFinally, Capgemini has implemented an audit program of internal \nand external risks at its operating sites, in partnership with an \nexternal consultant, covering environmental, health and Safety \nissues for people and buildings. This program is being roll-out \nprogressively, focusing initially on the Group’s main sites across \nthe globe. Audit recommendations are then monitored by the \nsite management team.\n\nPlease refer to Section\xa04.1.3.1 for more information on this risk’s \nmanagement system.\n\nFailure to adapt the services portfolio\n\nRisk factors\n\nThe adaptation of Capgemini’s service portfolio to rapid changes \nin technology and to meeting new client expectations could be \ntoo slow.\n\nUltimately, a poorly adapted service portfolio could lead to a fall \nin Group sales and a downturn in its margin.\n\nRisk management systems\n\nBy regularly adapting and renewing the portfolio of service \nofferings, a specific focus is placed by the Group on incorporating \ntechnological developments and new client requests. The Group \nimplements several processes to assess and integrate the relevant \ntechnological developments and new client requests. In certain \ncases, these technologies and the related expertise are acquired \nthrough external growth transactions.\n\nFor instance, the Group has recently acquired companies specializing \nin services related to cyber security, digital transformation in \nvarious industrial and technological fields, and digital marketing.\n\nPartnerships are also forged with universities, schools, research \ncenters, start-ups and independent experts.\n\nIn addition, training programs are rolled-out within the Group to \nguarantee perfect knowledge of these technologies and respond \nto our clients’ needs.\n\nAs part of the roll-out of the LEAD project, aimed at optimizing \nthe Group’s organization and governance, the global business lines \nwere tasked with defining and steering the service offerings. This \nnew structure will provide the Group with the agility necessary to \nincorporate changes in client and market expectations and adapt \nour service offering accordingly. To this end, the teams are working \non three complementary areas: identifying client needs and market \nexpectations, packaging offerings using go-to-market tools and \nrolling out offerings through centers of excellence.\n\nFinally, the Covid-19 pandemic crisis provided an opportunity to \ndevelop new offerings reflecting changes in client needs and their \nnew methods of operating, particularly with the rise in digital.\n\nMajor acquisition risks\n\nRisk factors\n\nCapgemini regularly acquires companies of varying sizes to strengthen \nits presence in certain markets or complete its service offering.\n\nAcquisitions always comprise a level of risk, that may be tied to \nthe financial solidity of the target, the complementarity of the \nbusinesses or the integration of its activities within Capgemini. \nIn particular, the integration process may prove more complex \nthan predicted, only produce a portion of the expected synergies \n(financial, commercial, technical or human, etc.), lead to the departure \nof key employees, mobilize significantly the teams involved and, \nultimately, not reach the objectives set and negatively impact the \nGroup’s financial results.\n\nCapgemini completed the acquisition of Altran and its initial \nintegration in the Capgemini business model.\n\nRisk management systems\n\nThe Merger & Acquisitions Committee, chaired by the Chief \nExecutive Oficer, examines acquisition projects in the course of \nidentification, selection, assessment or negotiation.\n\nPrior to each acquisition project, the Group performs due diligence \nprocedures, notably to analyze the potential exposure of the \ntarget to the Group’s critical risks, with the assistance of external \nconsultants. These audits cover both financial aspects and the \nvaluation of the target, as well as tax and legal, human Resources, \ngovernance, compliance and ethics issues.\n\nAn integration plan is drawn-up for every acquisition, to anticipate \nand monitor all key steps of the process, from a strategic, \noperational, financial and human perspective. Integration plans \nfor major acquisitions are presented to the Group Executive Board \nin special purpose reports.\n\nCapgemini implements a robust integration process founded on \nstrong governance and teams dedicated to aligning internal practices.\n\nc) Operational risks  \n\nLoss and lack of competitiveness\n\nRisk factors\n\nIn a highly competitive environment, increased by the pandemic \ncrisis, constantly adapting production capacity to changes in the \norder backlog (type and complexity of projects, location of projects, \nclient requests for increasingly short engagement completion \nperiods) is a major challenge for a service group such as ours. If we \ntake longer than our competitors to implement these adjustments, \nor we do so under less favorable conditions, our financial results \ncould be impacted.\n\n\n\nRISKS AND INTERNAL CONTROL \nRisk analysis\n\nCAPGEMINI 129\n\n3.\n\nIn this context, the Group pays close attention to various identified \nrisk factors, an increase in which could limit the ability to adapt \nthe Group’s production tool. Identified factors include limitations \ncurrently imposed by certain countries, including the United \nStates, on the location of certain resources in its territory, as well \nas regulatory changes in certain countries, notably concerning \ncompensation issues. Technological developments could make it \nmore dificult to secure specialist resources, increasing the cost \nof these rare profiles.\n\nMore generally, the Group could be unable to control changes in \nits cost base, materially impacting the overall profitability of its \noperations.\n\nRisk management systems\n\nThe definition of a good productivity level for our production \ncenters is a major issue for the Group. Several initiatives, processes \nand structures exist within the Group to meet this challenge, at \nboth human resource and systems levels.\n\nIn terms of governance and organization, the LEAD project places \ngreater responsibility on managers to know their markets and \nclients, enabling them to adapt their production capacity more \nrapidly to changing situations.\n\nAt the process level, technology plays a key role in the Group’s \nability to increase industrialization of certain low added-value \ntasks. To this end, initiatives concerning the main production \ncenters (India, Poland, etc.) were recently deployed to increase \nproduction capacity automation and agility.\n\nMajor delivery service failure\n\nRisk factors\n\nDificulties in performing services under contractual commitments \ngiven by the Group to its clients and/or the associated costs could \nbe underestimated. This may result in cost overruns not covered by \nadditional revenues, especially in the case of “fixed-price” contracts, \nor reduced revenues without any corresponding reduction in \nexpense in the case of certain outsourcing contracts where there \nis a commitment to provide a certain level of service.\n\nDespite the stringent control procedures that the Group applies \nin the project performance phase, it is impossible to guarantee \nthat all risks have been contained and controlled. In particular, \nhuman error, omissions, and infringement of internal or external \nregulations or legislation that are not, or cannot be identified in \ntime, may cause damage for which Capgemini is held liable and/\nor may tarnish its reputation.\n\nRisk management systems\n\nThe Group has developed a range of methods, organized and \ndocumented in its Deliver methodology, in order to ensure the \nhigh-quality performance of client projects. Project managers \nreceive specific training to develop their expertise and obtain \ncertification levels consistent with the complexity of projects \nentrusted to them. The Group continues its active policy of external \ncertification of its Business Units (CMM, ISO, etc.).\n\nProject performance monitoring satisfies the management and \ncontrol procedures defined by the Group, with projects classified \nas “complex” subject to more specific controls. Internal Audit \nalso verifies the application of project management and control \nprocedures. At the initiative of the Production/Methods and \n\nSupport Department, specialist teams of expert’s audit projects \nconsidered high-risk or facing performance dificulties.\n\nThe Group has devised a formal process to identify and control \nrisks associated with the delivery of projects ordered by clients, \nfrom pre-sale to acceptance and payment by the client of the \nlast invoice for the project. In a simplified approach, this process \ndifferentiates between:\n\n1.  pre-sale risk control\n\nDecisions to commit the Group to commercial opportunities and \nparticularly fixed-price projects and in Outsourcing (long-term \ncommitments, sometimes involving transfers of assets, staff and \nthe related obligations) are subject to risk analyses and an approval \nprocess adapted to their size, complexity and expected risk exposure. \nOpportunities meeting pre-defined size and complexity criteria \nare the sole responsibility of the Group Review Board. A specific \nreview of risks relating to the performance of these projects is \npresented to the Group Review Board.\n\nThe risk analysis is produced by Business Risk Management teams \npresent at the different Group levels. It is performed using a \nreporting and monitoring tool covering all commercial opportunities \nand involves the validation, during the sales process, of the main \ntechnical, financial and legal characteristics of the contract.\n\n2.  production and quality control\n\nThe Group has approved policies for monitoring the proper \nperformance of contracts that are applied throughout the life of \nthe project to ensure that it runs smoothly.\n\nThe main policies include a clear definition of the roles and \nresponsibilities of each individual, throughout the entire production \nprocess, regarding performance (use of Group production \nmethodologies, access to the expertise available in the applications \ndevelopment centers), supervision (monthly inventory of all “at-risk” \nprojects), client relationship management, billing, estimation of \ncosts to completion, joint oversight arrangements with the client, \nor, where applicable, independent technical audits conducted by \nthe Production/Methods and Support Department to complement \nthe upstream independent technical audits carried out by the \nBusiness Units.\n\nIn addition, the Group conducts specific reviews (known as “flying \nsquads”) of projects in dificulty or potentially presenting a higher \nlevel of risk.\n\n3.  business control \n\nDepending on its size, each Business Unit has one or more project \nfinancial controllers whose role is to:\n\n— mon itor the financial aspects of each project and primarily \nthe related production costs compared to the budget initially \napproved. Progress reports and management indicators are \nbuilt into the monitoring process, which relies mainly on the \nperiodic analysis of estimated costs to completion and their \naccounting impact; \n\n—  permanently control compliance with contractual \ncommitments – particularly billing and payment milestones.\n\nIn case of a significant deterioration in financial Key Performance \nIndicators, the Group may conduct specific reviews (known as \n“flying squads”).\n\n\n\nRISKS AND INTERNAL CONTROL \nRisk analysis\n\n130 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n3.\n\nd)  Security risks\n\nCyber risks\n\nRisk factors\n\nDigital technologies (Cloud computing, mobility, connected devices \nand artificial intelligence, etc.) and their professional and personal \nuse (social networks, Software-as-a-Service – SaaS, collaborative \nworking – DevOps, and sharing code and data, etc.) inevitably \nexpose the Group to new risks. In 2020, changes in working methods \nprovoked by the crisis and a rise in working from home, increased \nexposure to the risk of cyber-attacks.\n\nMalicious parties (individuals, organizations or even States, etc.) are \nincreasingly active with more and more sophisticated means. They \nobserve, analyze, test and challenge our information systems and \nthose of our clients. They work together in a structured approach \nusing artificial intelligence technologies. Any cybersecurity failures \ncould have an extremely negative impact on our reputation. human \nerror is also possible, as is employee non-compliance with Group \nrules, facilitating malicious acts.\n\nIn 2019, and again in 2020, threats across the entire supply chain \nincreased. Cyber criminals seek to compromise digital service \nproviders to attain their clients, or even their client’s clients. Threats \nand failures may also directly concern our clients and propagate \nto IT providers to which they are connected.\n\nRisks relating to all kinds of cyber criminality could lead to the loss \nor disclosure of data, delays in the delivery of our projects, service \ninterruptions at our clients, or additional costs that could impact \nthe reputation or financial health of the Group.\n\nRisk management systems\n\nThe Group continuously ensures the security of its tangible and \nintangible assets and compliance with its contractual commitments \nand any applicable legislative and regulatory provisions. It works \nto implement necessary and tailored preventive/protection and \ndetection/response measures with all stakeholders.\n\nTo this end, the Group’s Cybersecurity Department is tasked with \nanticipating, preventing and mitigating cyber risks impacting internal \ninformation systems and systems used for projects conducted \nwith our clients. The cybersecurity strategy defined for the Group \nhas four risk management pillars: managing internal and external \nthreats, managing external infrastructure vulnerabilities visible \nfrom the internet, managing compliance with laws and regulations \ngoverning cybersecurity (e.g. Network and information security \n(NIS) Directive of July\xa06, 2016) and data protection (e.g. GDPR \nEuropean regulation of April\xa014, 2016) and managing third-party \nsecurity (partners, suppliers).\n\nThis dedicated structure is headed by a member of the Group \nExecutive Board.\n\nThe Department constantly monitors cyber risk exposures. It \ncomprises three sub-units dealing with technology architectures \nand standards (responding to threats), governance tailored \nto the Group’s context (organization, guidelines and policies, \nawareness-raising and communication, control/audit plan and \ntransversal projects) and finally security operations (detection \nof threats and cyber-attacks, incident and crisis management).\n\nThe Group’s Cybersecurity community has four categories of \nstakeholder:\n\n—  the Group Cybersecurity Oficer and his team, who oversee \nthe above three areas; \n\n—  the Chief Information Systems Security Oficers in the \nBusiness Units, who are responsible for the deployment of \nthe strategy and policies in service offerings, client projects \nand internal information systems; \n\n—  the Cybersecurity Oficers in the Business Units in each \ncounty where the Group operates, who support the Business \nUnits and liaise with local authorities.\n\n—  managers responsible for the cybersecurity of projects \nconducted for our clients, guaranteeing the application \nof our internal policies/practices and compliance with our \ncontractual commitments.\n\nThe Group’s cybersecurity policies are rolled out uniformly in all \nGroup entities. They include aspects of the NIS Directive and are \nfounded on international standards (notably ISO\xa027001 and NIST – \nNational Institute for Standards and Technology – guidelines). They \ncomprise around 100\xa0mandatory minimum rules associated with \nthree types of policy (human Resources, Management, Technical) \nand supplemented by mandatory technical standards.\n\nISO\xa027001\xa0certification of the operating centers and Data Centers \nis mandatory and managed at Group level. At the end of 2020, over \n220\xa0sites were certified, representing 95% of our target.\n\nA mandatory cyber risk awareness-raising and training program \ncovers all employees to ensure common rules and discipline are \nrespected across the Group. Phishing tests are organized globally \nand locally, as well as specifically for certain client projects. Specific \ntraining actions are required depending on entity results.\n\nAt operating level, the Group is highly vigilant about the security \nof its internal communication networks and critical applications, \nwhich it protects via security rules meeting international standards \ncombined with proactive controls and tests.\n\nSpecific technical equipment is deployed and operated 24/7 \n(firewalls, anti-malware, access controls, encryption, threat and \ndata leak detection, email security, etc.). A cyber-attack detection \ncenter operating continuously guarantees the optimal management \nof any abnormal events and security incidents. This infrastructure \nand the related services can be used to support clients that have \nsuffered incidents.\n\nA Cyber-Risk Index was defined to quantify cyber risk exposure \nin six areas: Technology (internal vulnerabilities), human Factor \n(awareness-raising and phishing tests), External risks (exposure \nto the internet), Third-parties (suppliers and partners), Policies, \nCompliance. The index is calculated monthly for the Group and \neach entity and reported to the Management Boards.\n\nWith regards to business continuity, the Group has implemented \nbusiness continuity procedures in the event of a cyber-attack or \ninterruption to IT services. The main IT management systems are \ncovered by back-up plans in different data centers.\n\nFor some projects or clients, enhanced systems and network \nprotection is provided on a contractually agreed basis.\n\nIn this respect, a large number of our clients have been identified as \noperators of vital importance by their national authorities. Certain \nclients are or will also be identified as operators of essential services \n(OES) under the NIS Directive. The security of their information \nsystems must therefore be approved by the national authorities \nand our Group, as a major sub-contractor, must also comply with \nthese regulations.\n\n\n\nRISKS AND INTERNAL CONTROL \nRisk analysis\n\nCAPGEMINI 131\n\n3.\n\nTo meet global and transversal cyber threat challenges, the Group \nhas implemented a steering program grouping together the \nefforts of central functions: IT, Cybersecurity, Delivery, Legal and \nProcurement. These functions work together on key projects to \nstrengthen cybersecurity: system vulnerability and obsolescence \nmanagement, roll-out and control of policies, data protection, \nincident management, supervision of workstations. A monthly \nreport is presented to the Group Executive Board.\n\nPersonal security and occupational safety risks*\n\nRisk factors\n\nCapgemini’s employees are its primary asset: they are key to the \nGroup and their security is fundamental.\n\nIn the context of the health crisis, employee travel to countries that \nare geopolitically unstable or to dangerous regions where there \nis a risk to their physical integrity decreased significantly, helping \nto reduce exposure to personal security risk.\n\nNonetheless, systematic working from home in response to this \nhealth crisis could have physical or psychological impacts for \nGroup employees.\n\nOther risk factors tied to the sudden occurrence of major external \nevents (natural disasters, terrorist attacks, popular uprisings or civil \nwars, acts of banditry, etc.) could occur anywhere in the world and \nendanger the safety of individuals. The Group pays close attention \nto these risks.\n\nRisk management systems\n\nAt operating level, entity managers are responsible for the security \nof their own employees and employees made available to them. \nThe Group has implemented several measures to limit the impact \nand occurrence of risks to individual safety.\n\nThe security unit accompanies employees and managers 24/7.\n\nAccordingly, work on client engagements in certain countries \nclassified as “at risk” is subject to approval by the Group Review \nBoard. Rules and procedures have been drawn up for “at risk” \nterritories in which the Group conducts engagements in order to \nsatisfy the demands of its major clients.\n\nIn addition, specific contracts have been agreed with organizations \nspecialized in managing these risks to assess independently the \nrisk exposure in each country. Accordingly, some countries are \nsubject to strict travel bans. The risk is reassessed continuously \nbased on the geopolitical position and warning systems are used \nto inform employees of country risks.\n\nAll employees working in a foreign country receive specific training \nto raise awareness of specific situations to be taken into account \nduring the foreign assignment.\n\nAll employee trips to high-risk countries are closely monitored \nand compliance with the various clearly defined protocols and \ncommuniques is verified.\n\nThe Group also monitors access security to its building and those \nof its clients.\n\nFinally, a dedicated worldwide insurance program with a specialist \ncompany, provides assistance to all employees covering their \nsecurity, medical emergencies and potential repatriation (see \nSection\xa03.3 “Insurance”).\n\nIn the event of a crisis, a psychological support unit is available \n24/7\xa0to all employees worldwide.\n\nA mobile app also enables employees to issue an emergency message \nin the event of danger or an immediate need for assistance.\n\nFor more information on the Group’s health and Safety at work \npolicies, please refer to Section\xa04.1.1.6\xa0of this document.\n\ne)  Legal and regulatory risks\n\nData protection risk*\n\nRisk factors\n\nAs the volume of data generated worldwide increases daily, \nprotecting the data we process, both on our own account and for \nclients, is central to Capgemini’s data strategy. At the same time, \nregulatory pressure around data protection is growing.\n\nSince May\xa02018, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) \nhas provoked a shift in approach. While data protection has long \nbeen considered an administrative formality, it is now focused on \naccountability. Companies must now document their compliance \nprogram to demonstrate to data protection authorities and clients \nhow they comply with applicable laws. While data regulations have \nlong been primarily a Europe-centric concern, recent years have \nseen several non-EU countries, such as Brazil, Malaysia and Morocco, \nadopt relevant legislation. Industry-specific data protection laws \nhave also been adopted in the United States. In India, the data \nprotection law has been debated for many months and should \nbe adopted in the upcoming months. Interestingly, much of this \nlegislation copies the broad principles of the GDPR.\n\nCapgemini, like its clients, is subject to increased regulatory \npressure. It is therefore necessary for companies to adopt a global \napproach to data protection.\n\nThis approach is all the more necessary as, over and above the \nprinciples applicable to data processing, Capgemini and its clients \nare obligated to notify the authorities of security failures and data \nbreaches. At the same time, the pandemic has modified working \nmethods and companies must face new challenges and new risks.\n\nFinally, data privacy protection authorities could also impose financial \npenalties, exposing the Group to financial and reputation risk.\n\nRisk management systems\n\nTo mitigate increasing data protection risks, the Group has a \ncompliance program comprising a Group policy and procedures, \nsupported by a dedicated structure.\n\nThe Group Data Protection Oficer (GDPO) therefore defines and \nimplements the data protection program. The GDPO is supported \nby a network of Data Protection Oficers at local level and Data \nProtection Champions representing the functions and the Global \nBusiness Lines. This network ensures that the various data protection \nobligations are communicated and respected across the Group and \nalso that we adopt an approach that meets expectations in the field.\n\n\n\nRISKS AND INTERNAL CONTROL \nRisk analysis\n\n132 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n3.\n\nThe Group has implemented a range of policies and procedures to \nensure compliance with applicable data protection regulations. In \n2016, the Group adopted the Binding Corporate Rules (BCR) validated \nby all European data protection authorities. In January\xa02019, the \nGroup updated the BCRs and communicated the new version \nto the French data protection authority, to ensure compliance \nwith the new regulatory requirements. The BCRs constitute the \nGroup’s policy and apply to all Group entities. Commitments given \nthrough the BCRs are broken down into procedures and guidelines \nto enable their implementation. The Group thereby ensures that \nany personal data processing, performed either on its own behalf \nor that of its clients, incorporates data protection restrictions. \nSimilarly, during acquisitions or on the launch of a new business line, \nthe Group performs a focused due diligence review of the target \nor an analysis of the activity as well as of applicable regulations.\n\nFor a compliance program to be effective, employees must be \nproperly trained in data protection issues and challenges. We have \ntherefore rolled out a training program for all employees and more \nspecific programs for each of the Group functions.\n\nIn addition, Capgemini has implemented mechanisms measuring \nthe maturity of commitments to our clients, so as to monitor risks \nand take any necessary corrective action.\n\nFinally, in order to ensure the effective implementation of the \nvarious data protection principles and procedures, Capgemini has \nadopted and distributed several handouts to operating staff giving \npractical examples of the obligations incumbent on Capgemini \nand its employees.\n\nIn 2020, with a view to the integration of Altran, we defined an \naction plan to align our policies and procedures in 2021.\n\nMajor contract exposures and liabilities (pre-sale and \nservice delivery)\n\nRisk factors\n\nThe Group has entered into and signed numerous contacts and \nextensions to existing contracts and is not therefore immune from \nlitigation and legal action.\n\nThe Group operates in a competitive environment. Contractual \nrisks may notably arise when the Group‘s liability for failing to \nfulfill certain obligations is unlimited, or any limits on liability \nare disproportionate, on the acceptance of financial guarantees, \nwhen there is no liability protection clause in relation to services \naffecting health and Safety or the environment, and when the \nrights of third parties are not respected.\n\nIn a constantly changing regulatory environment, the significant \nproportion of projects to digitize clients’ key businesses exposes \nthe Group to new liability. These risks concern data protection and \nsecurity (see Data privacy, Section\xa04.2.2.2\xa0of this document) and \nthe development of new service offerings (artificial intelligence, \nInternet of Things, big data, etc.).    \n\nFinally, this risk can also stem from unfavorable conditions inherited \nfrom prior contracts negotiated by targets acquired by Capgemini \nand dificulties in adapting these ongoing contracts.\n\nRisk management systems\n\nThe Group has established Client Contract Negotiation Guidelines, \nwhich identify clauses exposing the Group to risk and require \ninformation to be reported to the Legal Department and its approval \nin the event of derogation from accepted standard positions. \nCriteria determining when it is necessary to report to the Group \nReview Board have also been defined for contracts identified by \nthe Group as presenting a high level of risk due to their size or \ncomplexity. The Group Review Board is the only entity authorized \nto approve derogating clauses following a thorough review of the \npotential impacts.\n\nDuring the pre-sale phase, the Business Risk Management dedicated \nstructure is in charge of analyzing the risks associated with the most \ncomplex projects, including their contractual terms. Throughout the \ncontract term, it regularly assesses the risks identified during this \nphase and oversees implementation of the action plans defined, \nunder the responsibility of the Business Units. The review process \nfor replies to tender offers has been strengthened, with notably \nthe addition of a review of contractual and operating risks and the \nidentification of mitigating measures to be implemented.\n\nA procedure has been implemented for reporting information \nto the Group Legal Department on actual and potential major \nlitigation and other disputes and government inquiries. A network \nof dedicated jurists has been created to accompany the Global \nBusiness Lines, global accounts, the negotiation of major contracts \nand the Group’s activities in the Financial Services sector.\n\nThere are no governmental, legal or arbitration proceedings, \nincluding any proceedings of which the Group is aware, that are \npending or liable to arise, which are likely to have or have had in the \npast 12\xa0months a material impact on the Group‘s financial position \nor profitability other than those that are recognized in the financial \nstatements or disclosed in the notes thereto (see Note\xa026\xa0to the \nconsolidated financial statements).\n\nAdverse changes and/or non‑compliance with laws \nand regulations*\n\nRisk factors\n\nThe Group is a multinational company operating in several countries \nand providing services to clients who, in turn, operate around the \nworld and are subject to numerous and constantly changing laws \nand regulations. These mainly include, for example, anti-corruption \nlaws, import and export controls, competition laws, data protection \nregulations, sanctions, immigration rules (the Group’s ability to \nrelocate resources abroad to serve projects), safety obligations and \nemployment legislation, stock market regulations or any changes \nto taxation (e.g. transfer pricing).\n\nThe sheer diversity of local laws and regulations applicable and \nthe constant changes therein, exposes the Group to a risk of \ninfringement of such laws and regulations by under-informed \nemployees especially those working in countries that have a \ndifferent culture to their own – and to the risk of indiscretion or \nfraud committed by employees. As stringent as they may be, the \nlegal precautions taken by the Group both at a contractual and an \noperational level to protect its activities or to ensure adherence by \nemployees to internal rules can only provide reasonable assurance \nand never an absolute guarantee against such risks.\n\nRisk management systems\n\nThe Group has a Legal Department with an established presence \nboth at Group level and in the main geographic areas. Its role is to \nmonitor changes in legislation relevant to the Group‘s contractual \nand corporate activities and provide training in the main legal issues.\n\n\n\nRISKS AND INTERNAL CONTROL \nRisk analysis\n\nCAPGEMINI 133\n\n3.\n\nIn addition, a Compliance Ofice, reporting to the Group General \nSecretary, was appointed at the end of 2020 to head the compliance \nSection of the Group Ethics & Compliance Program, in liaison with \nthe Legal Department and supported by the global network of local \nEthics & Compliance Oficers in the main regions where the Group \noperates. The governance of the Ethics & Compliance Program is \npresented in greater detail in Section\xa03.1.3.\n\nThe Group adopted a Code of Business Ethics to strengthen and \nroll-out within the Group an ethical culture promoting integrity \nof behavior. This Code defines, explains and formally documents \nthe Group’s action principles and rules of conduct and behavior \nconcerning employees, business integrity, commercial relations, \nGroup and third party assets, and Corporate Social Responsibility.\n\nThe Code of Business Ethics forms the basis for the compliance \nSection of the Group Ethics & Compliance program, mainly covering: \nthe fight against corruption and money laundering, duty of care \nand human rights, competition, sanctions and embargos, and \ndata privacy.\n\nThe Group has implemented detailed policies covering anti-corruption, \nconflicts of interest and competition laws.\n\nFor more information on the Group’s ethical risk management \nand compliance policy and notably the anti-corruption program \nimplemented by the Group, please refer to Section\xa04.2.2\xa0of this \ndocument.\n\nf)  Human resources risks\n\nHighly competitive market: impact on attractiveness, \nthe development and retention of talent and/or the \nloss of talent/key managers*\n\nRisk factors\n\nThe vast majority of the Group‘s value is founded on its human \ncapital and its ability to attract, train and retain employees with \nthe technical expertise necessary to the performance of the \nprojects on which they work. In particular, this requires a strong \nreputation in the employment market and ensuring fair appraisal \nand promotion procedures as well as the professional development \nand retention of our employees.\n\nThe development of new services based on mastering new \ntechnologies (cloud, digitalization, artificial intelligence, etc.) in a \nhighly competitive environment, can create tension in the talent \nmarket for certain profiles or expertise.\n\nThe loss of talent or a team could also follow accidental events, an \nacquisition or a change in Group or entity management.\n\nSimilarly, the Group could be affected by the accidental and/or \nunexpected departure of experienced managers, impacting the \ngovernance of certain activities or the operational management \nof projects conducted for the Group’s strategic clients.\n\nFigures concerning, in particular, the attrition rate, changes in \nheadcount, career management, the development of expertise, \nbuilding employee loyalty and the level of employee commitment \nare presented in Section\xa04.1.1\xa0of this document.\n\nRisk management systems\n\nThe Group pays close attention to internal communication, diversity, \nequal opportunity and good working conditions and to the quality \nof its human resource management and employee commitment. \nThe Group has therefore rolled out globally a continuous internal \nsurvey (Pulse) aimed at measuring commitment and expectations \namong the Group’s employees. This survey is an appraisal tool and \naction plans are established based on identified results.\n\nThe engagement and sense of belonging of Group employees are \nclosely monitored, notably as part of changes in working conditions \nrelated to the health crisis and the development of home working.\n\nSpecial attention was paid to talent retention during the Altran \nintegration process.\n\nFurthermore, our human resources management information system \nrolled-out globally by the Group human Resources Department \nensures the comprehensive management of all processes concerning \nthe management of high-performing individuals and enabling a \nuniform approach to monitoring performance, compensation \npackages, the career plans of our employees, the management of \ninternational mobility and succession plans, in a manner consistent \nwith the strategic objectives of the Group and the interests of \nour clients.\n\nThe Group has implemented several measures to limit the impact \nand occurrence of risks to individual safety. (see Personal security \nand occupational safety risks, Section\xa04.1.1.4\xa0of this document).\n\nFor more information on the Group’s human resources policies, \nplease refer to Section\xa04.1.1\xa0of this document.\n\ng) Reputation risks  \n\nCrisis management failure and reputation risk\n\nRisk factors\n\nNumerous events of varying nature (performance issues on major \nor sensitive projects, information system security breaches and/\nor failure to protect data privacy with the disclosure, voluntary \nor not, of confidential information, unethical employee behavior, \naccident involving a breach of individual security within Capgemini, \netc.) could arise and provoke a major crisis for the Group.\n\nThe Group has significant media exposure (in traditional media, \nsocial media, etc.) and a failure in the crisis management process \n(late decision or reaction, failure to reply to the media, etc.) could \nseriously damage the Group’s reputation and impact its credibility \nand image with clients and third parties in general, and accordingly \nits ability to main or develop certain activities.\n\nRisk management systems\n\nAll the risk management systems set out in this document and \nmainly those relating to employee safety, project performance, \ninformation systems and service continuity, contribute to preventing \nthe risk of a crisis and significantly reduce the Group’s exposure \nto reputation risk.\n\nIn particular, since 2011, the Group has implemented a solution for \nmeasuring and monitoring conversations on Group brands on social \nmedia. Internal social media are also monitored in order to best \nrespond to employee comments. Finally, in order to strengthen \ngovernance rules covering the activities of Group employees on \ninternal and external social media, a social media code of conduct \nwas also drafted and is freely available on the Group’s website.\n\n\n\nRISKS AND INTERNAL CONTROL \nRisk analysis\n\n134 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n3.\n\nAs a listed company on the Paris Stock Exchange and a global leader \nin its business sector, the Group is frequently called upon by the \nmedia and the financial community to provide information on its \nactivities. Therefore, to control and limit risks to its reputation, \nonly persons duly authorized by Group Management are permitted \nto speak on behalf of the Group.\n\nFinally, the Group has drafted a comprehensive crisis management \nplan to reduce its exposure to reputation risk in the event of a \nmajor crisis. This plan is currently in the test phase prior to its \nroll-out Group-wide.\n\nThe implementation and roll-out of crisis management in the \ncontext of the health crisis demonstrated the responsiveness and \ngood organization of the Group.\n\nUnethical behavior and misconduct*\n\nRisk factors\n\nThe risk associated with unethical behavior in companies has become \nincreasing visible in our economy: some resounding scandals have \nled the corporate world to question its practices and consider the \nneed to establish safeguards to prevent bad conduct or activities \nlikely to seriously damage both a company’s reputation and, \nultimately, its share price.\n\nThe issue of business ethics extends beyond legal requirements: \nit is notably influenced by changes in mentality, which express \nnew societal expectations and require changes in behavior in \ncompanies, in many cases before they become law. Examples \ninclude exemplary management conduct, respect for employees \nand notably the fairness of decisions concerning them, management \nof conflicts of interest between the interests of companies and \npersonal interests, the requirement for transparency in internal \ncommunications, as well as the purpose of products and services.\n\nThe existence of values at the heart of our business culture \npromoting unconditional integrity meets an increasingly urgent \nrequirement not only of external company stakeholders but also \nof employees, who increasingly favor companies with a strong \nethical culture comprising values consistent with their own when \nchoosing their career path.\n\nFinally, changes in our offering portfolio, notably towards the use \nof artificial intelligence, raise numerous new ethical issues that are \ncovered in a specific ethics code developed by Capgemini.\n\nRisk management systems\n\nSince 1967, Capgemini’s success is founded on its seven core \nvalues, first among which honesty and trust. Strengthened by this \nlegacy, the Group is nonetheless not fully immune to unethical \nbehavior by employees and managers: these actions could cause \nlasting damage to the Group’s reputation. The Group therefore \nimplemented an ethics program in 2009 to maintain and constantly \nstrengthen our ethical culture, both within the organization and \nin dealings with third parties.\n\nIn 2020, for the eighth year running, Capgemini was recognized as \nOne of the World’s Most Ethical Companies by the Ethisphere Institute. \nThis recognition is awarded to companies that adopt long-term \nresponsible strategies and play a key role in driving positive change \nin business practices and civil society internationally.\n\nThe Group has an independent Ethics Department that reports to \nthe Ethics and Internal Audit Director, who in turn reports directly \nto the Chief Executive Officer. This independent department \nis supported at local level by a network of Ethics & Compliance \nOficers. The Ethics Department is tasked with promoting the \nGroup’s core values and maintaining the ethical culture.\n\nThe Group Code of Business Ethics represents the continuation \nand formal documentation of cultural reflexes already firmly \nembedded in Capgemini. It is supplemented by detailed policies, \nnotably on our “speaking up culture” and our management of \nconflicts of interest.\n\nAll employees receive training on the Code of Business Ethics \nthrough an e-learning program which was completely revamped \nin 2020 and will now be presented annually: ethics@Capgemini is \nintroduced by a video from our Chief Executive Oficer and then \npresents our values and our ethical principles using a modern and \nmodular approach. Frequent additional training sessions, both \nface-to-face and webinars, are regularly held at local level by the \nEthics & Compliance Oficers to raise employee and manager \nawareness of appropriate – and inappropriate – behavior both in \nthe Company and with external stakeholders.\n\nCapgemini communicates regularly on the Group’s values and \nits “zero tolerance” policy towards unethical behavior. The “tone \nfrom the top” of leaders and managers on the importance of our \nvalues and compliance with ethical principles is promoted and \ncommunicated at all organization levels.\n\nThe Group’s ethical helpline, SpeakUp, enables employees and \nexternal stakeholders to report unethical behavior and ask \nquestions. Any reports are investigated by the Ethics Department \nand its local oficers.\n\nThe management of conflicts of interest in line with our conflict \nof interest policy was strengthened with the implementation of \na specific tool, which will be rolled-out across the Group in 2021.\n\nFinally, as an ethical leader, we are committed to ensuring \nartificial intelligence operates within an ethical framework which \nensures tangible benefits while developing trust in its use: we \nhave therefore published internally a Code of Ethics for artificial \nintelligence, to structure the development of AI solutions within \nthe Capgemini group.\n\nFor more information on the Group’s ethical risk management \npolicy, please refer to Section\xa04.2\xa0of this document.\n\nh) Financial risks  \n\nLiquidity risk\n\nRisk factors\n\nLiquidity risk for the Group could correspond to a temporary or \npermanent inability to fulfill all or part of its commitments in respect \nof its financial liabilities (including in particular borrowings and \naccounts and notes payable) or the inability to find new sources of \nfinancing in order to maintain the balance between revenue and \nexpenditure, continue its activities and undertake the necessary \ninvestments for its development.\n\nFinancial liabilities whose early repayment could expose the \nGroup to liquidity risk mainly consist of outstanding bonds and \nshort-term negotiable debt securities issued by Capgemini\xa0SE and \nsome commitments in respect of employee liabilities.\n\nRisk management systems\n\nThe majority of Group financing is borne by the parent company and, \nas such, implementation of the financial policy is largely centralized. \nThe Group adopts a prudent financial policy based primarily on:\n\n—  prudent use of debt leveraging, coupled with limited use of \nany clauses that could lead to early repayment of borrowings; \n\n— t he maintenance of an adequate level of liquidity at all times;\n\n\n\nRISKS AND INTERNAL CONTROL \nRisk analysis\n\nCAPGEMINI 135\n\n3.\n\n—  the active management of financial liability maturities, aimed \nat limiting the concentration of borrowing maturities; \n\n—  using diverse sources of financing, allowing the Group to \nreduce its reliance on certain categories of lenders.\n\nIn this context, the Company undertook a specific review of its \nliquidity risk and considers it is able to meet future scheduled \npayments (see Note\xa022\xa0to the consolidated financial statements).\n\nForeign currency risk\n\nRisk factors\n\nThe Group is exposed to two types of currency risk that could \nimpact earnings and equity: risks arising in connection with the \nconsolidation process on the translation of the accounts of \nconsolidated subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the euro, \nand currency risks arising on operating and financial cash flows \nwhich are not denominated in the entities‘ functional currency.\n\nThe significant use of offshore production centers in India, but also \nin Poland, China and Latin America, exposes Capgemini to currency \nrisk with respect to some of its production costs. Capgemini\xa0SE \nis also exposed to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations on \ninter-company financing transactions and royalties paid to the \nGroup by subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the euro \n(see Note\xa024\xa0to the consolidated financial statements).\n\nRisk management systems\n\nThe Group implements a policy aimed at mitigating and managing \nforeign currency risk:\n\n—  production cost risks primarily concern internal flows with \nIndia and Poland. A hedging policy is defined by the Group. \nIts implementation is mainly centralized at Capgemini\xa0 SE \nlevel and primarily involves forward purchases and sales of \ncurrency; \n\n—  financial flows exchanged as part of inter-company financing \nactivities are primarily centralized within Capgemini\xa0SE and \nare mainly hedged (primarily using forward purchases and \nsales of currency), except for financial flows that form an \nintegral part of the net investment in subsidiaries; \n\n—  royalty flows payable to Capgemini\xa0SE by subsidiaries whose \nfunctional currency is not the euro are also generally hedged.\n\nCounterparty and credit risk\n\nRisk factors\n\nCapgemini group is exposed to credit and counterparty risk in \nrespect to its asset financial instruments, which depends particularly \non the debtor’s ability to fulfill all or part of its commitments.\n\nFinancial assets which could expose the Group to credit or \ncounterparty risk mainly relate to financial investments (see \nNote\xa022\xa0to the consolidated financial statements) and accounts \nreceivable (see Note\xa020\xa0to the consolidated financial statements). \nThe hedging agreements entered into with financial institutions \npursuant to its policy for managing currency and interest rate \nrisks also expose the Group to credit and counterparty risk (see \nNote\xa024\xa0to the consolidated financial statements).\n\nRisk management systems\n\nThe investment policy authorizes the investment of cash surpluses \nin money market mutual funds satisfying “monetary” classification \n\ncriteria such as those defined by ESMA (European Securities and \nMarkets Authority) and other types of investment (negotiable debt \nsecurities, term deposits, capitalization contracts) immediately \navailable or with investment periods, potentially renewable, not \nexceeding three months, issued by companies or financial institutions \nwith a good credit rating (minimum A2/P2 or equivalent). The \nGroup also applies maximum concentration per counterparty rules.\n\nThe Group abides by risk quality/minimum rating and diversification \nrules when selecting counterparties for foreign currency and \ninterest rate management hedging contracts.\n\nEquity risk\n\nRisk factors\n\nFor the Group, equity risk would consist of unfavorable movements \nin the stock market value of listed companies in which the Group \nholds investments.\n\nhowever, the Group does not hold any shares for financial investment \npurposes and does not have any interests in listed companies. \nhowever, under its share buyback program, it may purchase, hold, \nsell or present its own shares or enter into derivatives in its own \nshares (see Note\xa012\xa0to the consolidated financial statements).\n\nRisk management systems\n\nThe Cash surplus investment policy defined by the Group Finance \nDepartment and documented in the internal manual (TransFORM), \nprohibits all equity investments. The proper application of this \npolicy is regularly controlled by the internal auditors.\n\nWith a few exceptions, the Group holds the entire share capital of \nits subsidiaries and does not hold any listed equity investments.\n\nCapgemini has a share buyback program authorized by its Shareholders‘ \nMeeting. In this context, the Board of Directors decides (with the \npower of sub-delegation) the implementation of the share buyback \nprogram. The value of these treasury shares is deducted directly \nfrom Group equity and fluctuations in the Capgemini share price \ndo not impact its results.\n\nInterest rate risk\n\nRisk factors\n\nThe Group’s Income Statement could be impacted by interest rate \nrisk if unfavorable movements in interest rates had a negative \nimpact on future net finance costs and financial flows of the Group.\n\nThe Group’s exposure to interest rate risk must also be considered \nin light of its cash position. The liquidity at its disposal is generally \ninvested at floating rates (or failing this at fixed-rates for periods of \nthree months or less), while the Group’s debt – primarily comprising \nbond issues – is nearly entirely at fixed rates (see Note\xa024\xa0to the \nconsolidated financial statements).\n\nRisk management systems\n\nAs part of its financing policy, the Group seeks to restrict interest \nrate risk by opting for fixed rates for a large part of its debt.\n\nThe Group favors investments offering a high level of security \nand generally floating-rates and as such accepts – in the event \nof a fall in interest rates – the risk of a drop in returns from the \ninvestment of cash surpluses (and as such an increase in the finance \ncost differential).\n\n\n\nRISKS AND INTERNAL CONTROL \nRisk analysis\n\n136 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n3.\n\nRisks relating to employee liabilities\n\nRisk factors\n\nCapgemini’s consolidated financial statements could be impacted \nby provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefits \nrelated to defined benefit plans, which are also subject to volatility. \nFurthermore, the Group could be faced with calls for funds to \nmake-up pension fund shortfalls, over a short or long-time period, \npotentially deteriorating its financial position.\n\nThe main factors of volatility risk are fluctuations in interest rates \nand more generally the financial markets, as well as inflation rates \nand life expectancy.\n\nThe plan assets of the main schemes whose risks have not been \ntransferred to the insurance market are managed by the trustees of \neach fund and invested in different asset classes (including equities). \nThey are subject to market risk, as well as the performance of the \nmanagement policy defined by the trustees, implementation of \nwhich can in certain cases be delegated. Under these conditions, plan \nassets may be less than the present value of pension obligations, \nreflecting a funding shortfall or deficit. Changes over time in assets \nand/or liabilities are not necessarily in the same direction and \n\n(1) International Integrated Reporting Council\n(2) Global Reporting Initiative\n(3) Sustainability Accounting Standards Board\n\nare eminently volatile and can increase or decrease the funding \nasset/liability or the resulting deficit. Nonetheless, the potential \neconomic impact of these changes must be assessed over the mid- \nand long-term in line with the timeframe of the Group’s pension \nand other post-employment benefit commitments (see Note\xa025\xa0to \nthe consolidated financial statements).\n\nRisk management systems\n\nThe Group strives to maintain a governance structure and management \nresources appropriate to the risk profile of its main pension funds. \nThe investment strategy for these pension funds, encompassing the \nmanagement of assets and liabilities, is reviewed and monitored \nperiodically. It seeks, in particular, to reduce volatility and make-up \nany shortfalls over a period consistent with the average duration \nof employee liabilities, through contributions and the return on \nplan assets. Increased life expectancy is taken into account as and \nwhen it is recognized by actuaries.\n\nGroup commitments to fund pension and other post-employment \nbenefit shortfalls comply with local regulations.\n\nCertain risks are transferred to the insurance market.\n\n3.2.2  Corporate & Social Responsibility Materiality Assessment\n\nMateriality Review\n\nOur success depends on our ability to work constructively with \nour stakeholders, to improve outcomes for all. We rely on the \nknowledge and insight that stakeholders can bring to support \nrobust business decisions. This ongoing dialog helps us to provide \nthe services our clients need, and act as a responsible business.\n\nSince 2018, we have built on the stakeholder engagement process \nwe have been evolving over the past few years, most notably with \nthe development of a new materiality assessment. In line with the \nIIRC (1) Integrated Reporting Framework, we consider economic, \nsocial, environmental and governance topics to be “material” if \nthey have, or may have, an effect on our ability to create or protect \nvalue. This is determined by considering their effect on our strategy, \ngovernance, performance or prospects. A materiality review helps \norganizations to identify and rank the topics that matter and ensure \nthese are built into decision-making, strategy and governance, as \nwell as bringing focus and relevance to reporting.\n\nWe have taken five key steps to evolve our materiality review \nsince 2018:\n\n1.  we reviewed and expanded our list of potentially material \ntopics developed in 2017, through a process of analyzing \nindustry and reporting guidelines (including IIRC, GRI (2) and \nSASB (3)), conducting media and peer reviews and assessing \nour potential to impact the UN Sustainable Development \nGoals and targets. We also evaluated the alignment of these \ntopics and definitions with our Group Risk Management \napproach including risk mapping;\n\n2.  the findings of this process were validated by an expert \nSteering Committee, made up of senior executives, with \nclear definitions agreed for each topic; \n\n3.  we gathered external stakeholder perspectives on these \ntopics through interviews with key stakeholder groups \n(clients, investors & analysts, business partners, NGOs & \ncharity partners), with a focus on understanding their views \non the importance and ranking of topics in their relationship \nwith Capgemini; \n\n4.  we gathered internal stakeholder perspectives from \nthe Steering Committee and a sample of employees’ \nrepresentative of the Group’s demographics, through \nsurveys and questionnaires, with a particular focus on \nassessing the potential impact of each topic on Capgemini’s \nability to create and protect value; \n\n5.  the findings from this process have been validated and taken \nforward by the Steering Committee and are an important \ninput both for this report and the Group Integrated Report.\n\nTo satisfy the requirements of Article R.\xa0225-105\xa0of the French \nCommercial Code and the duty of care law, non-financial risks across \nthe Group’s entire value chain were mapped in 2020, encompassing \nthe activities of Capgemini, its subsidiaries, its suppliers and its \nsub-contractors. The methodology, which is aligned with the Group \nrisk mapping methodology, is detailed in Section\xa04.3.1 and 4.4.1.2.\n\n\n\nRISKS AND INTERNAL CONTROL \nRisk analysis\n\nCAPGEMINI 137\n\n3.\n\nTo ensure continuity of treatment, this risk mapping was based on \npast work performed by the Capgemini and Altran groups and on \na comprehensive inventory of existing actions. Work to align the \nmethods enabled a global risk analysis methodology framework \nto be defined, thereby sustainably integrating Altran into the \nGroup scope.\n\nThe update of the Group risk mapping offered an opportunity to \nensure its consistency with the non-financial risk mapping. The \nfollowing Cross-Reference Table highlights the Group’s critical \nrisks and related significant non-financial risks:\n\nMaterial topics  \n(from 2018 materiality \nassessment) Critical risks

\nthe identification, assessment, prevention, protection and transfer \nof all or part of the risks relating to individuals, assets and goods \nowned by the Group or under its responsibility.\n\nThe Group’s strategy for transferring risks to the insurance market \nis to adjust insurance coverage to reflect the estimated maximum \nexposure to each of the Group’s major risks This involves, for example, \nin the case of liability insurance, an estimate of its own risks and \nreasonably foreseeable third party risks in its business sector and \nin the case of asset insurance, the maximum replacement value of \nbuildings and assets to be insured.\n\nAccount is taken of:\n\n—  local insurance obligations, legislation and specific risks in \neach country,\n\n—  the emergence of new risks,\n—  changes in major exposure, particularly under contacts \n\nsigned with clients.\n\nDeductibles and retentions are set so as to encourage Business Unit \nmanagers to commit to risk prevention and protection and seek \nout-of-court settlement of claims, without exposing the Group as \na whole to significant financial risk.\n\nThe Group Risk & Insurance Department reports to the Group \nFinance Department and is responsible for the design, placement \nand monitoring of all non-life insurance policies. The management \nand coordination of employee benefits insurance is overseen by a \njoint governance body representing the Finance/Risk & Insurance \nDepartment and the Group human Resources Department.\n\nCommercial general liability and professional \nindemnity\n\nThis insurance program, which is key for clients, is designed, \ntaken out and managed centrally at Group level. Capgemini\xa0SE \nand all subsidiaries in which it has a stake of 50% or more (direct \nor indirect control), are insured by a worldwide integrated Group \ninsurance program covering the financial consequences of their \ncommercial general liability and professional indemnity, i.e., any \n\ndamage caused to third parties within the course of our usual \nbusiness activities, anywhere in the world. This insurance program \nis structured in layers contracted with highly reputable leading \ninsurance companies. The terms and conditions of this program, \nincluding coverage limits, are periodically reviewed and adjusted \nto reflect changes in risk exposure, due particularly to legislation, \nthe Group’s activities, new countries where Capgemini operates \nand changes in client contracts, as well as changes in the worldwide \ninsurance and reinsurance markets.\n\nThe program’s largest policy, amounting to €20\xa0million, is historically \nreinsured with a consolidated captive reinsurance subsidiary.\n\nProperty damage and business interruption\n\nThe Group has set-up an integrated property damage and business \ninterruption insurance program covering all of its subsidiaries \nworldwide. Its real estate policy is to rent rather than to buy its \nbusiness premises. It owns little property, except in India where \nhigh growth and the large number of employees justify owning \nreal estate.\n\nCapgemini‘s business premises are located in a wide variety of \ncountries, and the Group operates at multiple sites in most of them. \nThe Group has slightly over 631\xa0sites with an average surface area \nof 3,745\xa0square meters. Some of the Group’s consultants work \noff-site at client premises. This geographic dispersion limits risk, in \nparticular the risk of loss due to business interruption that might \narise from an incident at a site. The Group’s largest site, which is \nlocated in India, employs nearly 18,651\xa0people in a number of different \nbuildings. Client and supply shortage risk is assessed and insured \nto the extent possible, based on knowledge of the materiality of \nthe risk and the available offering in the insurance market.\n\nEmployee benefits and mobility insurance\n\nThe Group uses specialist companies to train and assist its employees \nthroughout the world. Risks concerning medical emergencies, \npersonal security, assistance and repatriation of employees working \noutside their home countries, is managed centrally at Group level \nvia global insurance policies.\n\n\n\nRISKS AND INTERNAL CONTROL \nInsurance\n\nCAPGEMINI 139\n\n3.\n\nEmployee benefits insurance programs (death and disability, \nhealthcare, medical costs, life and pensions, etc.) are tied to the \ndifferent benefits received by employees and are generally managed \nby the human Resources Departments in each country. The Group \nRisk & Insurance and human Resources Departments are jointly \nresponsible for the management and international coordination of \nthese programs. Decisions are taken jointly by the Group and the \ncountries in compliance with the governance structure.\n\nThe main objectives are (i)\xa0to comply with local insurance obligations, \n(ii)\xa0to comply with local legislation, (iii)\xa0to develop, standardize \nand improve current coverage, in accordance with the different \nregulations in the relevant countries and coverage standards \n\nintegrating best local practices for the Group’s businesses, while \noptimizing alternative risk transfer/financing mechanisms.\n\nOther risks\n\nCrime and fidelity coverage (especially for information systems) is \nmanaged centrally at Group level via a global insurance program. \nOther risks – including motor vehicle, transport of goods, and \nemployer liability for workplace accidents – are insured locally \nusing insurance policies that reflect local regulations.\n\nSome risks are excluded from coverage or restricted under the \ngeneral conditions imposed by the insurance and reinsurance market.\n\n\n\nRISKS AND INTERNAL CONTROL \nInsurance\n\n140 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n3.\n\n\n\n4.\n\nCAPGEMINI 141\n\n4.\nOur commitment as \na responsible leader  \n4.1 C orporate, social, and environmental policies and results 143\n4.1.1  People and Inclusion  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 143\n\n4.1.2  Digital Inclusion . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 168\n\n4.1.3  Environmental Sustainability . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 172\n\n4.1.4  Employee engagement through volunteering . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 184\n\n4.2 Ethics & C ompliance 186\n4.2.1  Values and Ethics  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 186\n\n4.2.2  Compliance . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 188\n\n4.2.3  Group Tax Policy . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 191\n\n4.3 Dut y of care 192\n4.3.1  Our approach: Risk Mapping . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 192\n\n4.3.2  Our achievements  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 193\n\n4.4 Methodolog y and scope for non‑financial information 195\n4.4.1  Alignment with French legal requirements on Déclaration de performance extra‑financière . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 195\n\n4.4.2  Methodology and scope of non-financial performance indicators. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 198\n\n4.5 E xternal Report on the Déclaration de performance extra‑financière 205\n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \n \n\n142 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n4.\n\nThe statement on non-financial performance (Déclaration de performance extra‑financière) was reviewed and approved by the Board on \nFebruary\xa017, 2021, after a first review by the Audit & Risk Committee on February\xa016, 2021.\n\nA responsible leader, leveraging technology for the benefit of all\n\nCapgemini is a responsible leader, determined to have a positive \nimpact on all stakeholders within our ecosystem.\n\nAs a Group we believe that digital transformation should benefit \nall of humanity and intend to be a benchmark in terms of our \ncontribution to society, for our own activities, and for those of \nour clients. This will see us fighting exclusion, acting to promote \ndiversity, ensuring equal opportunities and preserving natural \nresources. Building a viable and sustainable ecosystem for all \nsits at the very heart of our purpose: “Unleashing human energy \nthrough technology for an inclusive and sustainable future”. We \naim to enable this purpose with technology, drawing on the energy \nof our talented teams and of our clients and partners. \n\nUsing our operational excellence, innovative assets, and added-value \npartnerships, we link technology, business and society to deliver \nsustainable solutions to all our stakeholders.\n\nOur employees are essential to our success. They are specialists \nrecognized in their fields of expertise, working on the frontline \nof business transformation, embodying our entrepreneurial \nculture, and delivering leading-edge services. To achieve our \nambitious growth objectives, we invest in our teams, attract and \nretain top talents in our industry, and offer our people motivating \ndevelopment opportunities, including international career paths. \nWe also ensure that we offer them a dynamic environment that \nfosters performance, where dialog and a spirit of conquest are \nencouraged and rewarded. Our approach is all about creating a \ndiverse and inclusive work environment where our employees can \nthrive and bring the best value to our clients.\n\nWe are a leader in digital transformation and our mission has \nbecome even more important as we aim to help our clients seize all \nthe opportunities offered by technology to keep their employees \nsafe in these times of crisis. Simultaneously, we seek to help them \nensure their business continuity, as well as boost their agility and \ncompetitiveness to prepare for the future. In addition, the world \nis facing social and environmental challenges that call for swift \nand strong action by companies and institutions. In 2020, with the \ncreation of our Social Response Unit in the context of the Covid-19 \npandemic, we have expanded upon our existing social impact efforts \nto purposefully apply our technology expertise and passion where \nmost needed in the fight against Covid-19.\n\nOur value creation model is presented in detail in Section\xa01.3.1\xa0of \nthe Universal Registration Document.\n\nThe Group is realistic when it comes both to promises and to the \nrisks associated with technological innovation: our role is to make \nit responsible, useful and accessible.\n\nCapgemini’s success has always stemmed from our ability to build \ntrusted relationships with all our stakeholders, in accordance with \nour values and high standards of ethics and performance. Data \nprotection and security are crucial for each afiliate of Capgemini, \nand we have created a strong internal organization to protect \nthe Company and its clients against these risks. Our Ethics and \nCompliance programs are essential for the success of a diverse, \ndecentralized Group like ours. Our 7\xa0core values are at the heart \nof our culture, uniting our multicultural teams and inspire our \nextremely high expectations of behavior in all our business dealings, \nunderpinning our approach as an ethical business.\n\nArchitects of Positive Futures, our Corporate Social Responsibility \nprogram, is one of the essential components of our strategy \nto become a leading responsible company by leveraging three \nfundamental pillars: Diversity & Inclusion, Digital Inclusion, and \nEnvironmental Sustainability. Our Group has long advocated for \ndigital inclusion and the fight against climate change, notably by \nreducing our carbon emissions and developing service offerings \nto reduce our clients’ emissions. This will help make the digital \nrevolution an opportunity for all and deliver positive solutions \nfor environmental issues.\n\nOur multicultural organization, resolutely anchored in all communities \nwhere we operate, is now more resilient, committed, united and \nagile than ever before.\n\nPublic commitments\n\nAs a responsible and sustainable-focused business, Capgemini \nadheres to commitments made in several areas, at national, \nregional, or global level. Our commitment extends beyond strict \nlegal compliance to ambitious global initiatives in several areas:\n\n—  we are signatories of the UN Global Compact since 2004. The \nmember companies of this program support and comply with \nten principles in the areas of the environment, human rights, \nlabor rights and the fight against corruption; \n\n—  in 2020 we joined the “Valuable 500”, which is a global CEO \ncommunity revolutionizing disability inclusion through \nbusiness leadership and opportunity; \n\n—  we joined the International Labor Organization’s “Global \nBusiness and Disability Network”; \n\n—  we are signatories of the Women’s Empowerment Principles \nsince 2011; \n\n—  we are signatories of the UN Global Compact’s “Caring for \nClimate” initiative since its inception in 2007; \n\n—  we became a signatory to the RE100, committing to transition \nto 100% of our electricity to renewable sources by 2025; \n\n—  we became a signatory to the Taskforce for Climate-related \nFinancial Disclosures, supporting action to build resilience to \nclimate change through climate-related financial disclosures; \n\n—  Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) validated our carbon \nreduction targets as being in line with the level of reduction \nneeded to limit global warming to 1.5°C; \n\n—  we became a founder member of UN’s Race to Zero campaign \n– a coalition of leading net zero initiatives, representing \n452\xa0 cities, 22\xa0 regions, 1,101\xa0 businesses, 45\xa0 of the biggest \ninvestors and 549\xa0universities; \n\n—  we signed the Business Ambition for 1.5\xa0degree targets; \n\n—  we signed a joint letter along with over 170\xa0CEOs to European \nheads of state calling on them to increase emissions reduction \ntargets to ensure they reach their net zero target by 2050;\n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nCorporate, social, and environmental policies and results\n\nCAPGEMINI 143\n\n4.\n\n—  we signed up to TEDx Countdown, a global initiative to \nchampion and accelerate solutions to the climate crisis, \nturning ideas into action over a year-long campaign;\n\n—  Capgemini France signed up to Planet Tech’Care’s manifesto \nfurther strengthening its commitment to responsible digital \ntechnology. Capgemini France also signed a charter with \nthe Institut du Numérique Responsable https://institutnr.org/ \nsupporting a training platform for employees on digital \nsustainability; and\n\n—  we joined the Business 4\xa0 Inclusive Growth (B4IG) coalition \nwhich is a partnership between the OECD and a CEO- led \ncoalition of global organizations, where we are leading a \nworking group on the digital divide.\n\nMoreover, through our global policies and our Architects of Positive \nFutures program, we are committed to helping achieve the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals set by the United Nations, and particularly the \nones set out below, given the nature of our activities and impact:\n\nCSR governance\n\nThe Chief CSR Oficer is responsible for executing the Corporate \nSocial Responsibility (CSR) strategy for the Group, and is a member of \nthe Group Executive Committee, comprised of leaders representing \nbusiness units, business lines, countries and corporate functions. \nThe Chief CSR Oficer reports to a Group Executive Board member. \nThe CSR strategy, key initiatives and periodic updates are presented \nto and ratified by the Group Executive Board and mobilized through \nthe Group Executive Committee. Our CSR strategy comes to life \nthrough a network of CSR leaders and teams at country-level in main \ngeographies and at business lines level, who in turn orchestrate \nthis effort through Employee Resource Groups, afinity networks \nand colleagues across the business. Country Boards or equivalent \nmanagement teams in our operating units play an important role \nin leading by example and supporting CSR goals and resources in \ntheir respective country. Finally, we have networks for each pillar \nof our CSR strategy. It is through these networks that we accelerate \n\nalignment in initiatives across the Group, leverage best practices \nand amplify impact to society, planet and our people.\n\nIn addition, we have established this year a new governance model \nto support the development of our net zero program, involving \nvarious Group functions, which is described further in Section\xa04.1.3.\n\nThe Board of Directors of Capgemini\xa0SE promotes long-term value \ncreation by taking into consideration the social and environmental \nchallenges of its activities. At the end of 2018, the Board of Directors \nentrusted its Strategy & Investment Committee, subsequently \nrenamed Strategy & CSR Committee, with a specific duty relating \nto the monitoring of the Group’s CSR strategy, ensuring consistency \nin the consideration of social and environmental aspects in the \nGroup’s main strategic orientations. Each year, one Board meeting is \ndevoted to monitoring the Group’s CSR strategy and progress made \ntoward our targets, based on a report issued by the Strategy and \nCSR Committee. The Board also ensures that the compensation of \nthe CEO and top management includes objectives and performance \nconditions in line with our CSR strategy.\n\n4.1  Corporate, social, and environmental policies and \nresults\n\n4.1.1  People and Inclusion\n\n4.1.1.1  Business challenges and our people culture\n\nCapgemini is a people-oriented business. Together, we tackle the \nchallenges of today and tomorrow in a demanding environment, \nworking closely with our clients to build the future they want. This \nrequires a constant refresh of our collective capabilities and we \ndo so by leveraging the expertise, creativity and commitment of \nall our people. We believe everyone joining Capgemini is a talent \nin the making. Through offering individualized learning paths, \nappropriate guidance, and coaching, as well as fostering a positive \nand healthy work environment, we build an inclusive culture where \nevery form of diverse talent thrives.\n\nThe world moves at an ever-increasing pace with a high level of \nuncertainty, impacting all our stakeholders (our people, clients, \npartners), as well as our society and the environment. As a business, \nit is important for us to continuously adjust to the fast pace of \n\ntechnological progress and align the skill requirements of our \npeople accordingly. As a responsible employer, it is important \nfor us to effectively manage those impacts and respond to the \nexpectations of our workforce. This year, the Covid-19 crisis affected \nevery single one of our employees. It required immediate crisis \nmanagement measures to be put in place to prioritize our people’s \nsafety and wellbeing. The social, environmental, and geopolitical \nunrest exacerbated by this crisis have added to the overall sense of \nuncertainty, affecting our employees, our clients, and our partners \nin various ways. It has reinforced our belief in the need for a holistic \napproach to inclusion and sustainability.\n\nThis year was also a year of growth for our Group. Capgemini was \nable to seize new opportunities by acquiring Altran and welcoming \n50,000\xa0new colleagues from that acquisition, with complementary \ncapabilities and skills.\n\nhttps://institutnr.org/\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nCorporate, social, and environmental policies and results\n\n144 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n4.\n\nThe Capgemini culture is at the heart of everything we do and \neverything we stand for. Our seven corporate values (honesty, \nBoldness, Trust, Freedom, Team Spirit, Modesty, Fun), defined in \n1967 by the Group’s late founder Serge Kampf, confer a strong \nidentity on the Group and aims at providing a feeling of belonging \nfor our people. In 2020, Capgemini defined its company purpose \nas “unleashing human energy through technology for an inclusive \nand sustainable future’”, to act as a beacon to our employees to \nbe inspired and engaged in pursuing the common goal of making \nan impact in the world. This is further translated through our new \nbrand promise “Get the future you want”. This aims to empower our \ntalents to actively engage and shape that future for themselves, \nour clients, our partners and for the planet and society through \ntheir daily work. Our CSR strategy on the diversity pillar provides \nthat direction by setting up a vision and ambition, guaranteeing \nfair management and fostering a strong culture of Diversity and \nInclusion.\n\nWe believe that our Capgemini brand is a key asset for attracting \ntop talent in the market. We have hired more than 47,000\xa0people \nwith a gender balance ratio above 40%. A continued global effort \non improving Capgemini as an attractive employer has shown in our \noverall Glassdoor rating and number of reviews. In particular, in 2020 \nwe received an industry-leading 4.0\xa0rating (out of a 5-point scale, \nwith 4\xa0indicating employees are “satisfied”) for India, the country \nwhere the Group recruits most of its talent. Capgemini increasingly \ngains market recognition in terms of diversity and people awards, \ndriven by various inclusion and employee experience programs. \nWe have further built out our reach on expert capabilities through \ndigital channels, like LinkedIn, where we now source a substantial \nshare of talented employees at mid-and senior level.\n\nWe put a particular focus on welcoming and integrating into our \ncompany the large share of young professionals who join us every \nyear. From the very start of their careers, we set expectations for a \ndynamic growth environment with quarterly promotion opportunities \nbased on their project contributions and the speed at which they \nacquire relevant skills. To empower our employees further on \nthis path, we have deployed NEXT, a digital learning experience \nplatform that enables access for all employees to relevant and \nbroad learning assets, curated by the world’s best knowledge \nproviders. We enable our workforce to constantly grow and align \nto current and future skills needs. The Covid-19 crisis prevented \nus from making use of our iconic University Campus in 2020, but \nwe made a successful switch to virtual events. This allowed the \ncontinuous development of training programs and ensured that \nwe could maintain the feeling of belonging and camaraderie \nengendered by key professional communities, such as the Global \nArchitects community. In 2020, the Group announced its business \nstrategy around industry leadership through data and cloud. The \nsuccess of this strategy directly depends on our ability to provide \nand offer the working environment and conditions in which our \nemployees can apply their professional skills, while enabling them \nto seize personal growth opportunities.\n\nWe also focus on developing advanced People Management skills \nand practices in our middle management and leaders, as well as \nequipping them with the right tools. The Connected Manager \nprogram, in partnership with leading academic institution harvard \nUniversity, supports all our managers through a hybrid and flexible \ndevelopment model. We continuously work on improving our \nalready robust approach to Vice-President hiring, promotion and \nreward, and review this key population in the annual Strategic \nTalent Reviews for development, succession, and mobility actions.\n\nCapgemini provides a flexible work environment, with modern ofices \nin major urban locations, and has embraced the productivity and \ncommunication equipment needed for employees to work from \nanywhere, anytime. We fully deployed an enhanced integrated \nproductivity suite that enabled seamless communication across \nour entire workforce and cohort of clients and partners.\n\nAs such, we were well equipped to handle the Covid-19 crisis, with \nlittle disruption to our client operations thanks to:\n\n— a s trong people safety setup in place to locate and repatriate \nemployees across borders; \n\n—  proactive crisis management setup piloted by the Group; \n—  a leadership focus on people’s wellbeing by ensuring an \n\nadequate work environment at home and more continuous \nconnection with the teams through various channels.\n\nDriven by the pandemic, the attrition rate (share of voluntary \ndeparture) dropped by more than 7\xa0points (20% in 2019), to less \nthan 13%, which represents close to 33,000\xa0voluntary departures. \nThis decrease in attrition has been consistently observed across \nour ofices globally. It is subject to ongoing monitoring in order for \nus to assess whether it is line with sectoral trends and to ensure \nthe appropriate measures are deployed to respond to the needs \nof each department and region.\n\nFor the past few years, the Group has focused on providing a \nhighly engaging ‘People Experience’ structured by a holistic People \nExperience Framework that covers the candidate and employee \nexperience end-to-end. To better understand the expectations \nof our employees, the digital “Pulse” platform, where more than \n70,000\xa0employees give their voice every month, captures this employee \nfeedback anonymously and enables line managers to directly see \nhow their teams perceive their work experience. This allows us to \nact fast and, at all levels of the organization, develop a tailor-made \nemployee experience in line with employees’ expectations. In turn, \nthis increases our attractiveness in the talent market. Using the \nPulse platform during the Covid-19 crisis allowed us to sense our \nemployees’ perceptions and was leveraged for an initial pulse check \nof our 50,000\xa0Altran colleagues to identify common strengths and \nkey differences for use in people integration activities.\n\nCapgemini continued constructive labor relations through the \nInternational Workers Council (IWC), which is involved in all major \ndecisions and is a partner in the continuous transformation of \nour Group.\n\nWe attach strong importance to aligning our People and Inclusion \nactivities and initiatives with the United Nations’ Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals (“SDG”) in the following way:\n\n —  Providing our employees a safe environment (SDG 3 Good \nHealth and Wellbeing)\n\nAs a people-oriented company, we are committed to providing a \nstimulating, fulfilling and safe professional environment to all our \nemployees and we pay particular attention to their physical and \nmental wellbeing, something even more important in times of crisis \nwhere feelings of uncertainty and isolation can grow. To this end, \nwe have implemented a wide set of policies – personalized training \npaths, feedback culture, helplines, health coverage, well-being \ninitiatives,\xa0etc. – reflecting our commitment to providing a safe \nenvironment to our employees to evolve, thrive and get support \nwhen needed.\n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nCorporate, social, and environmental policies and results\n\nCAPGEMINI 145\n\n4.\n\n —  Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and \npromote lifelong learning opportunities for all  \n(SDG 4 Quality Education)\n\nNow more than ever, we strongly believe in the power of our people, \nand the role that Learning and Development plays in all stages of \ntheir lives and careers. We have ensured that all our employees in \nnearly 50\xa0countries have equal access to the same high quality and \ninclusive learning opportunities through heavy investments into \nworld-class digital learning technologies. More than just providing \nour people with resources to succeed, we also prioritize ongoing \nskills development at all levels of the organization to make sure \nthat our employees develop lifelong learning habits that will serve \nthem well both at Capgemini and everyday life, while ensuring their \nemployability in order to meet demanding market requirements.\n\n —  Achieve gender equality and empower all women and \ngirls (SDG 5 Gender Equality)\n\nWe believe in an inclusive culture where every form of diverse \ntalent will shape our future. By encouraging more women to \njoin our business and empowering them with career paths and \nopportunities, we gain different perspectives that are essential in \nthe rapidly changing world in which we operate. In that sense, we \nhave committed to set strong foundations and continue to deploy an \nactive strategy to promote Diversity and Inclusion across our Group, \nclosing the gender gap when it comes to accessing management \nand executive positions, ensuring that all our employees, from \nacross diverse backgrounds, fully participate in corporate life and \nin decision-making processes at all levels.\n\n —  Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic \ngrowth, full and productive employment and decent work \nfor all (SDG 8 Decent Work Economic Growth)\n\nPeople are our biggest asset and main performance lever and we \nare committed to provide all of our employees, irrespective of their \nbackgrounds (gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, differences \n\nin abilities,\xa0etc.) a decent, safe and inclusive work environment. \nFor that, we have implemented a set of policies around inclusion, \nhealth and Safety, rewards and compensations and are committed \nto continuously engage with our employees to measure their level \nof satisfaction and wellbeing in the workplace.\n\n —  Empower and promote the social, economic and political \ninclusion of all, irrespective of age, sex, disability, race, \nethnicity, origin, religion or economic or other status \n(SDG 10 Reduce inequality within and among countries) \n\nAs a global and people-oriented business, Capgemini has long held \nthe belief that Diversity and Inclusion set us apart. In that sense, we \nhave always put responsibility at the heart of what we do, and this is \nexpressed by our purpose to build a more inclusive and sustainable \nfuture. Our various people-oriented policies (representation of \nwomen, LGBT+ community, disabled people, health & Safety for \nall,\xa0etc.) pave the way for a more tolerant, inclusive work environment \nwhere everyone is given the same opportunity to grow, evolve and \nthrive as an employee and individual.\n\nChanges to the headcount: growth driven by Altran \nacquisition in 2020\n\nThe Group’s headcount broke the symbolic barrier of 200,000\xa0employees \nat the start of 2018, just over seven years after crossing the \n100,000-employee mark in September\xa02010. While headcount grew \nagain in 2020 by more than 22%, it has been entirely fueled by the \nAltran acquisition, which brought nearly 50,000\xa0new employees. \nThis meant we reached close to 270,000\xa0employees at year end. \nDue to the Covid-19 crisis, there was no organic headcount growth \nin 2020 for the first time since 2009.\n\nThe average headcount is calculated by adding the average headcount \nat the start of the financial year and the headcount for 12\xa0months, \ndivided by 13.\n\nChanges over total headcount\n\n Average total headcount Headcount as at 31 December\n\nYear Scope Number Change Number √ Change\n\n2016 C 185,593 4.4% 193,077 6.9%\n\n2017 C 196,755 6.0% 199,698 3.4%\n\n2018 C 204,904 4.1% 211,313 5.8%\n\n2019 C 216,104 5.5% 219,314 3.8%\n\n2020 C+A 251,525 16.4% 269,769 23.0%\n\nScope: (C) stands for Capgemini legacy, (A) stands for Altran legacy and (C+A) for Capgemini and Altran\n√ Data identified in these tables by a √ has been reviewed by Mazars with a reasonable level of assurance.\n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nCorporate, social, and environmental policies and results\n\n146 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n4.\n\nThe very significant headcount growth in 2020 is related to the \nacquisition of Altran (effective April\xa02020) with the onboarding of \n49,889\xa0employees. After several years of strong organic growth, \nparticularly marked in Asia-Pacific, the Covid-19 crisis drove a \nheadcount decrease during the second and third quarters, before \na year-end rebound. The integration of Altran had an impact on the \n\ngeographical breakdown of the Group’s employees, with an overall \nincrease in Europe, as Altran had a stronger European footprint. \nNevertheless, Asia Pacific remains the strongest region by far with \nmore than 50% of employees based in this region. The evolution \nis reported in the table below.\n\nGeographical breakdown of the headcount\n\n \n31 December 2018 31 December 2019 31 December 2020\n\nHeadcount\n(C)\n\nHeadcount\n(C)\n\nHeadcount √ \n(C+A)\n\n%\nC+ARegions % %\n\nNorth America 17,582 8.3% 17,848 8.1% 18,550 6.9%\n\nUnited Kingdom and Ireland 8,338 4.0% 8,877 4.0% 10,489 3.9%\n\nNordic countries 4,573 2.2% 4,884 2.2% 5,401 2.0%\n\nBenelux 8,143 3.9% 8,264 3.8% 9,616 3.6%\n\nGermany and Central Europe 15,306 7.2% 16,309 7.4% 21,997 8.2%\n\nFrance 24,761 11.6% 25,518 11.6% 36,219 13.4%\n\nSouthern Europe 9,284 4.4% 9,977 4.6% 19,932 7.4%\n\nAsia-Pacific 113,223 53.6% 117,423 53.6% 135,567 50.3%\n\nLatin America 8,268 3.9% 8,282 3.8% 8,110 3.0%\n\nMEA 1,835 0.9% 1,932 0.9% 3,888 1.4%\n\nTOTAL 211,313 100% 219,314 100% 269,769 100%\n\n \n\nScope: (C) stands for Capgemini legacy, (A) stands for Altran legacy and (C+A) for Capgemini and Altran The above data reflects the headcount as of 31\xa0December\xa02020 for the \nentire Group (100% coverage Capgemini + Altran). \n\n√ Data identified in these tables by a √ has been reviewed by Mazars with a reasonable level of assurance.\n\nThe Asia-Pacific region increased by 9\xa0points in 2015 following the \nbuyback of IGATE, which mainly operates in India. It continued to \ngrow and broke the 100,000-employee barrier in December\xa02016. By \n31\xa0December\xa02020, the region totaled more than 135,000\xa0employees, \nthus recording a further increase in its headcount, with Altran \nbringing 15,000\xa0employees from this geography (mostly from India). \nhowever, the overall weight of the region decreased by more than \n3\xa0points as the Altran footprint is stronger in Europe, in particular \nin France, Southern Europe and Germany. The Americas weight \nalso decreased by 2\xa0points. Out of this total, India now represents \n47.3% of the whole Group’s headcount.\n\n4.1.1.2 Inclusion\n\nThe world of business is increasingly global. As the Covid-19 \npandemic has shown us, it is easier than ever to use digital channels \nto collaborate and work with clients or partners from anywhere in \nthe world. With globalization comes diversity – of ethnic groups, of \ncultures, of gender, and so much more – bringing new nuances and \ninsights that can be turned into competitive advantage and make \nwork a better place to be. Inclusion is also a human right, by which \ndiverse people from all walks of life and those with disabilities can \nbe part of society, as the United Nations’ Sustainable Development \nGoals (SDGs) explicitly reference. however, diversity also raises the \nspecter of exclusion as some companies struggle to embrace and \nrespond to the needs of a diverse workforce or fail to see its value. \nThey are missing out on a wonderful opportunity.\n\nAs a global organization, Capgemini has long held the belief that \nDiversity and Inclusion set us apart. Being a people-oriented \nbusiness, we have always put responsibility at the heart of what \nwe do, and this is expressed by our purpose to build a more \n“inclusive and sustainable future”. The Diversity and Inclusion \npillar of our Corporate Social Responsibility program aims to \ndeliver on this purpose.\n\nPolicies and actions\n\na)  A culture of inclusion\n\nDiversity and Inclusion are essential to our Group identity. We \nbelieve that the collaboration of diverse and multi-cultural teams, \npromotes creativity and innovation, leading to an inclusive culture \nto the benefit of all.\n\nOur definition of diversity encompasses cultural identity, ethnicity, \nsocial origins, sexual orientation, ideologies, working methods, \ngender identity and disability. To best integrate the value of \ndiversity in our corporate culture, we focus on inclusion to ensure \nthat all employees feel valued and included.\n\nCapgemini’s diverse workforce of 270,000\xa0employees, in nearly \n50\xa0countries representing more than 120\xa0nationalities, brings \na wide array of expertise, profiles, and experience. By working \ntogether, while integrating these differences, our employees are \nencouraged towards greater personal and professional growth, \ncan thrive and generate new ideas, anticipate market trends, and \nbe thought leaders in our chosen markets.\n\nInclusion is a business imperative for the Group, and a lever to \nensure we can deliver higher value to our clients. By bringing in \nsuch diverse talent, we enrich our teams with different skills and \nperspectives, allowing us to adjust, adapt and react proactively to \nrapidly evolving client needs.\n\nWe continue to fight the gender gap that is still present in our industry. \nTo this end, we have put in place an active strategy to promote \nDiversity and Inclusion. We aim to ensure that female employees \nfully take part in both corporate life and decision-making processes \nat all levels on an equal footing with their male counterparts.\n\nOur goal is to provide a stimulating professional environment, in \nwhich employees are encouraged to share their point of view and \nare engaged in meaningful work. Capgemini promotes a policy of \ncontinuous professional development for all employees, improving \ntheir skills and ensuring their employability. This commitment is \nanchored in various practices, such as performance management, \na strong feedback culture, and in a wide range of training \n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nCorporate, social, and environmental policies and results\n\nCAPGEMINI 147\n\n4.\n\nopportunities so that each employee is adequately supported. \nOur people also have the opportunity to participate in various \ninitiatives – designed for different grades and positions – that \nenable them to contribute beyond their work with clients. These \ninitiatives support the development of internal commitments \nlinked to their areas of interest.\n\nTo guarantee Diversity and Inclusion as core elements of our \nidentity, we pursue three main commitments:\n\n1.  Set up a leadership vision and ambition – engage everyone in \nconstantly improving their conduct and action as key players \nin our ambition. \n\n2.  Guarantee fair management, from hiring to development, \npromotion to career changes, commitment to retention of \nemployees at all levels – promote positive interventions.\n\n3. F oster a strong culture of diversity and an inclusive \nenvironment – ensure a safe and respectful workplace where \nthere is equality, fairness, consideration, and a friendly \nenvironment.\n\nWe truly believe in “People First” and during these unprecedented \ntimes, our focus is on the health and wellbeing of our colleagues \nand their families. Along with the various Contingency Response \nProgrammes – we curated Happiness & Well‑being as an important \ndimension of our inclusion agenda to enhance experience of our \npeople and staff, along with advancing gender balance, embracing \ndiversity, driving LGBTQ+ inclusion and multiculturalism.\n\n“Happiness & Wellbeing” is a holistic offering to our employees, \nbringing together diversity, inclusion, and physical and emotional \nwellbeing under a single umbrella. happiness and Well-being is \ncritical for personal and organizational transformation, as it starts \nwith the individual and translates the positive effects to people \naround – strengthening the belongingness and optimizing the \npotential of the Group. Subsequently, it aims to:\n\n—  improve outreach by engaging with employees and giving \nthem a platform to openly discuss mental health; \n\n—  ensure inclusivity by extending the benefits of the program \nto a wider ecosystem and targeting employees’ families; and\n\n—  improve operational performance and profit margins \nby boosting productivity and ensuring employees are \ncommitted and motivated.\n\nb)  Inclusion for women\n\nWe have made good progress with respect to increasing the \nrepresentation of women in our organization at all levels over \nthe last few years. Over the next two years, a key focus for us is \nto improve the pipeline of future women leaders at Capgemini. \nThis involves increased hiring of women from entry to managerial \nlevels, developing female talent, and retaining and progressing \nthis talent through a series of targeted initiatives:\n\n—  to improve hiring, we plan to increase employer branding, \nre-focus job descriptions, train recruiters and ensure greater \ndiversity in interview panels; \n\n—  in terms of talent development, the Group is targeting \nthe expansion of mentoring programs, along with the \nstandardization and scaling of specific programs that have \nproven to be successful at local or country levels;\n\n—  the roll out and implementation of a flexible work policy \n(adjusted by geography and role) is a key element of our \nretention strategy; and\n\n—  through our Diversity and Inclusion Learning and Development \nprograms for managers and unconscious bias training, we \nwill further enhance a culture that values and celebrates \nDiversity and Inclusion.\n\nAll these initiatives will be orchestrated and thoughtfully deployed to \nachieve the goal of improving our pipeline of future women leaders.\n\nAlthough diversity goes beyond gender, we tackle gender diversity \nas a key issue given the scale of the challenge. Diversity policies \nrelating to ethnicity, LGBTQ+ and better integration of disabled \nemployees into our workforce are handled locally in alignment \nwith local regulation and conventions, with best practices shared \nacross the Group. In pursuit of our efforts, we have set relevant \nobjectives and KPIs and track our progress diligently.\n\nBreakdown of the headcount by gender:  \nchanges in 2018-2020 √\n\nThe below data refers to 99.7% of the headcount as of 31\xa0December\xa02020, \nincluding Altran:\n\nWomen Men\n\n20\n\n80\n\n70\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n10\n\nDecember 2018 (C)\n\nDecember 2019 (C)\n\nDecember 2020 (C)\n\nDecember 2020 (C+A)\n\n66.3%\n\n31.9%\n33.0%\n\n34.9%\n33.7%\n\n65.1%\n\n67.0%\n\n68.1%\n\nScope: (C) stands for Capgemini legacy, (A) stands for Altran legacy and (C+A) for \nCapgemini and Altran\n\nHeadcount evolution: Capgemini legacy basis\n\nThe number of women has increased at a steady pace, reaching \n34.9% of the headcount on a Capgemini legacy basis at the end of \n2020. This compares to 33% in 2019 and 31.9% in 2018, so represents \na further increase of 1.9\xa0points in 2020, denoting an improvement \nof 5.1\xa0points over the last 5\xa0years. This positive evolution reflects \nthe success of the gender diversity policies we have implemented.\n\nThis figure is not evenly distributed at Group level and depends \non the type of activity or the geographical area. For example, \nCentral Europe, Asia-Pacific and Latin America are above the \nGroup average, while Benelux, even though slightly improved, \nremains in the low 20s.\n\nOverall, the breakdown between men and women is in large part \na reflection of the situation in the IT and Engineering sectors, \nwhich recruit mainly from engineering schools, whose graduates \nare predominantly male in most countries. But it also highlights \nthe impact of our mix of activities and countries on the overall \ngender balance in the headcount.\n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nCorporate, social, and environmental policies and results\n\n148 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n4.\n\nA higher percentage of women in the headcount is evident in \nthree areas: Business Services is close to parity at 48.9%, while \nConsulting and Financial Services are at or above Group average. \nAt the recruitment stage, the total proportion of women increased \nto 42%, which is a 6-point climb compared to the previous year. We \nmust maintain this increase to keep improving diversity. however, \nthe number of women decreases consistently as we progress to \nhigher grades and the percentage of women falls to 19.2% at \nVice-President (VP) level. It is noteworthy however, that the VP \npercentage increased by 1.8\xa0point in 2020 and by 4.3\xa0points over \nthe last two years driven by our focus and targets on VP inflow \n(external recruitments and internal promotions).\n\nWith regard to employee retention, the percentage of women taking \nvoluntary departures, out of the percentage of total voluntary \ndepartures, remained at the same level as last year, at 32.5%. This is \nbelow the overall percentage of women in the Group’s headcount, \ndriving a lower attrition rate for women than for men of 0.8\xa0point.\n\nThe proportion of women increased in India, where we reported a \n37.7% gender mix at year end, representing +4.3\xa0points increase. \nGiven the size of the headcount in India, this contributed significantly \nto improving the gender balance of the Group overall.\n\nIn addition, countries where Business Services are firmly established \ncontribute positively to the number of women in the Group, with \nthe proportion of women in Poland, China, and Guatemala close \nto, or higher than, 50%.\n\nIn contrast, the proportion of women falls below the 25% mark in \neleven countries where we have smaller operations, representing \njust 4.3% of the total headcount.\n\nImpact of the Altran acquisition\n\nFollowing Altran’s acquisition, the consolidated gender mix is down \nto 33.7% as the mix within Altran stands at 28.4%. This is consistent \nwith comparable companies having a significant proportion of \nengineering work, like Altran.\n\nApart from Belgium and France where the gender mix is slightly \nhigher than within the Capgemini legacy perimeter, the result of \nthe Altran acquisition is that all other countries are at or below \nthe legacy gender mix percentage.\n\nGender related actions taken during the Covid‑19 crisis \n\nSeveral of the actions taken across the Group to support our \nemployees during the pandemic were gender related. These included:\n\n—  in India: The “Parents at CG” initiative (an internal forum) \nwas set up to enable people to share information/tips with \nrespect to parenting in the midst of the pandemic (almost \n1086 members); \n\n—  in Germany: Communication was ramped up via the Employee \nAssistant Service (Familienservice) and a special hotline \nsupport for Covid19-related issues. The CEO of the Northern \nEurope Strategic Business Unit communicated directly with \nemployees (email & podcast), using as reference an article \nwritten by the local head of Diversity and Inclusion; and\n\n—  in Poland: The StayWell@home initiative was set up to offer \nsessions specifically designed to keep children occupied.\n\nWe also set up initiatives supporting women outside of the \nCapgemini network like the one in France, where the Serge Kampf \nCampus in Les Fontaines and staff were mobilized to shelter victims \nof domestic violence during two months at the time of the first \nFrench lockdown.\n\nMore women at higher grades\n\nWith regard to career development, we are committed to promoting \nwomen in managerial positions. The proportion of women promoted \n\ninternally to the highest grade of Vice-President (VP) reached a \nrecord high of 29.3% during the 2020 promotion campaign, just \nabove the target of 29% for women onboarded to VP positions \n(both recruited externally and promoted internally). In addition, \nthe percentage of external hires exceeded the threshold of 30% \nin 2020 at 30.9%, reflecting a pro-active recruitment policy and in \nline with our objectives. The proportion of women at VP level has \nincreased by 1.9\xa0points, although it remains lower than the total \nshare of women in our headcount.\n\nMore generally, the number of women at the highest grades \nincreased again in 2020. In particular, the Mediterranean countries \nhave the highest proportion of women at these grades – above 20%.\n\nThe Group-wide strategic talent reviews give a good overview of \nour gender balance. They are carried out in all operational units \nand help us to identify high potential candidates at all grades and \nmanagement levels combined. Our CEO takes a close interest in the \nprogress made on this front, following-up with the dedicated team \nin charge and engaging on this topic in various business meetings.\n\nSeveral measures support these efforts and contribute to promoting \nthe presence of women in the VP talent pool: local executive \ntraining courses, mentoring conducted by senior executives, \nand increased visibility and exposure for women identified as \nhighflyers. A specific focus following the integration of Altran and \nthe associated organizational changes will ensure that varied and \ndiverse management teams are appointed.\n\nEvolution of the proportion of women in management \npositions (Capgemini legacy scope)\n\n12%\n\n20%\n\n16%\n\n8%\n\n4%\n\n14.9%\n\n2016\n\n15.6%\n\n2017\n\n16.3%\n\n2018\n\n17.5%\n\n2019\n\n18.6%\n\n2020\n\nAs part of Capgemini’s Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) ambition \nendorsed by our CEO, we have conducted deep-dive analyses on \ngender diversity across the Group since 2019. This helped us spot \nkey areas in need of attention and identify gaps to be addressed. \nFollowing the analyses, we embarked on a series of interviews with \nhR and the heads of D&I in our main countries and Global Business \nLines. This gave us a preliminary understanding of the challenges in \nterms of gender diversity at each stage of the employee lifecycle: \nhiring, promotion and retention. This effort was greatly supported \nby reporting dashboards we implemented in 2019. Further, in 2020 \nwe initiated the monitoring of Group gender diversity targets at \nmore granular and actionable levels.\n\nOur activity shifted this year to focus more on improving the \nrepresentation of women in our workforce between entry and \nmanagerial levels and mending the “broken rung”. This initiative \nis critical to creating a strong foundation for gender balance at \nCapgemini and for a sustainable and reliable pipeline in senior \nmanagerial and leadership roles.\n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nCorporate, social, and environmental policies and results\n\nCAPGEMINI 149\n\n4.\n\nTo further address this specific challenge, a new project is being \nlaunched in 2021 that aims to improve gender diversity at early \ngrades. It will help mobilize the main D&I and hR stakeholders across \nentities to capture both the bigger picture of gender diversity \nchallenges and our Group ambitions. The project will enable us \n\nto share and be inspired by the best gender diversity practices \nacross the Group and discuss the major pillars of action needed to \nimprove the shape of the talent pyramid. This is a turning point for \ngender diversity at Capgemini and lays the foundations for similar \ninitiatives addressing other D&I dimensions.\n\nResults and Key Performance Indicators (KPI)\n\n KPI 2018 2019 2020 \n2021 \n\nTarget\n\nScope C C C/C+A C+A\n\nPromoting gender  \nparity in management \nteams\n\nShare of women in executive leadership\n\nShare of promotions to Vice-President positions that \nare women (internal promotions and external hiring)\n\n14%\n\n24%\n\n16.8%\n\n29%\n\n20.3% (C) \n\n30% (C) \n\n22%\n\n30%\n\nPromoting gender  \nparity in the Group\n\nShare of women in the workforce 31.9% 33% 34.9% (C) √ \n33.7% (C+A) √ \n\n+1\xa0point\n\n \n\nScope: (C) stands for Capgemini legacy, (A) stands for Altran legacy and (C+A) for Capgemini and Altran.\n√ Data identified in these tables by a √ has been reviewed by Mazars with a reasonable level of assurance.\n\nRecent recognition\n\nIn India\n—  Capgemini India received the award of second runner up in \n\nthe Gender-Inclusive workplace category from the United \nNations Women 2020 Asia Pacific WEPs in recognition \nof our commitment towards gender inclusivity. This \naward is important as it goes beyond mere organizational \ncommitment to Diversity and Inclusion, and recognizes \nactual milestones achieved through the implementation of \nfocused frameworks and initiatives, such as WinspirE and its \nvarious elements: fareWelcome and CAPtivate; \n\n—  Best companies for women by AVTAR Group & Working Mother \nMedia; and\n\n—  Most inclusive companies by AVTAR Group & Working Mother \nMedia.\n\nIn North America\n Best Company for Dads by Working Mother Media; and\n\n—  2020+ Top Companies for Executive Women by Working \nMother Media.\n\n— \n\nIn UK\n—  Times Top 50\xa0 best Employers for Women – listed for the \n\n4th\xa0year running and identified in the top 10% of employers \nfor the last 10\xa0years; and\n\n—  Best Tech Employer and Flexible Working by Women in Tech \nEmployers Awards.\n\nIn Germany\n—  Best employer for Women (5\xa0stars out 5) by Brigitte.\n\nIn Spain (Altran)\n—  Gold recognition by Ecovadis; \n—  Top 30\xa0companies with best practices in Diversity, Inclusion \n\nand Equality by Intrama; \n— T op Employer (2018 Top 10, 2019 in the 6th\xa0position, in 2020 in \n\nthe 2nd\xa0position) by TOP EMPLOYER; and\n—  National Alares Award for Work-Life Balance and Corporate \n\nSocial Responsibility (Year 2019).\n\nc)  Disability and inclusion in the workplace\n\nIn accordance with our deep belief that a workplace where people \ncan thrive leads to the best innovation and business solutions, our \nDiversity and Inclusion efforts also focus on actively embracing \nour colleagues with disabilities – any limitation on business or any \nrestriction in participating in society as a result of lasting impairment \nof a person’s mental or physical abilities constitutes a disability. \nTheir perspective brings a new dimension to our teams, whilst \nembodying society’s diversity within our company.\n\nIn 2017, we joined the International Labor Organization’s Global \nBusiness and Disability Network. This is a network of several \nmultinational enterprises, employers’ organizations, business \nnetworks and disabled persons’ organizations who share the \nconviction that talent and expertise can be found everywhere.\n\nIn 2020, we joined the Valuable 500, which is a global CEO \ncommunity revolutionizing disability inclusion through business \nleadership and opportunity. This initiative is putting disability on \nthe business agenda. This symbolizes our commitment towards \ndisability inclusion.\n\nAs a Digital services organization, we know that people and skills \ndevelopment are a company’s real capital. Above and beyond our \ncommitments to people with disabilities, technological innovation \nrepresents a tremendous opportunity for compensating disability, \nbe it visible or not. We have only scratched the surface of the \nimmense opportunities that exist for supporting a growing number \nof users towards better inclusion.\n\nThe policies for the inclusion of people with disabilities and \ntheir results vary depending on the countries where the Group \noperates. The “Focus on” Sections below provide a snapshot of \nsome initiatives, policies and actions taken in different countries.\n\nGeographical breakdown of employees with disabilities in 2020\n\nRegions/Scope C A C+A\n\nItaly 88 76 164\nGermany 104 68 172\nUSA 175 4 179\nPoland 85 N/A N/A\nUnited Kingdom 712 N/A N/A\nFrance 636 249 885\nIndia 285 15 300\nSpain 57 9 66\nBrazil 32 N/A N/A\nTOTAL 2,174 452 2,626\n\nScope: (C) stands for Capgemini legacy, (A) stands for Altran legacy and (C+A) for \nCapgemini and Altran.\n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nCorporate, social, and environmental policies and results\n\n150 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n4.\n\nFocus on France\n\nWe have been actively implementing a policy of inclusion for people \nwith disabilities since 2006. In 2019, we signed a fifth Disability \nAgreement with state-approved social partners, in which we \nagreed to pursue this policy. This program is driven by the “Mission \nHandicap” and covers five areas:\n\n—  recruitment and integration of people with disabilities; \n—  continued employment for people with disabilities; \n—  training with an objective of improving skills and \n\nemployability; \n—  awareness raising and communication to fight against \n\nprejudice and improve understanding; and\n—  subcontracting workers from the sheltered sector, which \n\nincludes “Entreprises Adaptées (EA)” and “Établissements \net Services d’Aide par le Travail (ESAT)” – a network that \nfacilitates employment for people with disabilities. This \naims to promote the indirect employment of people with \ndisabilities. We can also support our clients with this kind of \nsubcontracting to comply with their requirements for social \ninclusion.\n\nDuring the annual French Event (SEEPh: European Week for the \ninclusion of disabled people in November), we organized several \nevents aimed at erasing the stereotypes surrounding disability. The \nprogram includes web-conferences (about illnesses, such as cancer, \nmultiple sclerosis, and cardio-vascular disease), escape-games, and \nquizzes highlighting the different disability situations employees \nmight face.\n\nWe also take part in the “handy Tech” trophy awards ceremony. \nThis aims to coordinate and encourage all those who innovate or \nsupport technological (including AI) innovation geared to helping \npeople with disabilities, or who are losing their autonomy.\n\nOur commitment to this policy is reflected in an employment rate \nhigher than that observed in the rest of our sector of activity: \n3.34% in 2019 compared to an average of 2.5%, according to Syntec \n(Capgemini legacy scope). At the end of 2020, 885\xa0people with \ndisabilities were employed within the Group in France (including \nCapgemini and Altran). Our aim is to hire an additional 102\xa0people \nwith disabilities in 2021.\n\nFinally, within the “Handi‑Accueillante” standard (NF X50-783), aimed \nat increasing the employment rate for people with disabilities by \nimproving their autonomy at work, we account for the fact that \ncertain processes and tools may need to be adapted for employees \nwith disabilities in their daily activities. This is particularly relevant \nwith digital accessibility for visually impaired employees.\n\nWe have developed an e-learning module on digital accessibility for \nour entire workforce. We have also developed e-learning programs \nto improve skills regarding disability and inclusion. A common \nsection addressing all our employees covers the recruitment and \nintegration team network, looking at how to integrate a disabled \nperson; and a second session for managers and hR teams to look \nat what disability is and how to respond.\n\nFocus on India\n\nOur Inclusion of Persons with Disability (PWD) program aims to \novercome barriers to access to employment, self-development, \nand career growth opportunities for PWD. It takes a four-pronged \napproach that addresses issues around: Accessibility, Career, \nEngagement and Awareness, as follows:\n\nAccessibility\n\nRemoving barriers by providing accessible infrastructure, IT systems, \nand reasonable accommodation to people with disabilities.\n\n—  reasonable adjustments: we make every effort to adapt to \na person’s impairment by structuring the role or the work \nenvironment in a manner that will enable someone with a \ndisability to perform the essential functions of the job. For \nexample, providing sign language interpretation support to \na candidate with hearing impairment during the interview \nprocess, providing training material in an accessible format, \nand making the premises accessible; \n\n— s elf-identification form: Capgemini in India launched a \nDisability Self Identification Form to allow people with \ndisabilities to voluntarily disclose their disability and take \nadvantage of reasonable adjustment benefits. This provides \na platform for them to share their concerns, and benefit from \nreasonable adjustments to obtain tax rebates under IT law \nwith the relevant documentation and certification; and\n\n—  infrastructure accessibility audits and modifications: we \nwork with vendor partners (Diversity and Equal Opportunity \nCenter and Social Equity) to conduct periodic infrastructure \naudits of our premises and have made modifications to \nensure accessibility.\n\nCareer\n\nEnsuring inclusion through our non-discriminatory recruitment \nprocess, training, and hR policies.\n\n—  recruitment: ensuring non-discriminatory recruitment \npractices so that people with disabilities have equal \nopportunity to participate. This includes sensitizing, training \nand making all panel members across India aware of the \nCompany’s focus on hiring people with disabilities. Capgemini \nalso proactively encourages people with disabilities to apply \nthrough external recruitment communication; \n\n—  a job analysis is conducted for each position to ascertain \nthe challenges a person with disability may face. This \nincludes accessibility testing of applications based on WCAG \n2.1\xa0 guidelines for web content accessibility. In some cases, \nroles may be restructured or redefined to ensure equal \nopportunity; \n\n—  growth and development: creating a career trajectory for \npeople with disabilities and ensuring internal engagement. \nThis includes upskilling and cross-skilling through various \ntraining programs; and\n\n—  our PWD mentoring network was launched for employees \nat certain levels who have worked with Capgemini for more \nthan four years. In this program, the PWD employees are \nassigned mentors who are senior leaders and able to provide \nproper guidance and career counselling.\n\nEngagement\n\nEngaging employees through sensitization and cultural awareness \nand communicating on the importance of inclusion.\n\n—  disability awareness training is part of new-hire on-boarding \nand is mandatory for all employees; \n\n—  Capgemini has developed a process and targeted \ninterventions to hire PWD; and\n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nCorporate, social, and environmental policies and results\n\nCAPGEMINI 151\n\n4.\n\n—  the Disability Self Identification Form: As mentioned above \n(see ‘Accessibility’), the form has a voluntary disclosure \nscheme through which employees can ask for reasonable \nadjustments to their job structure or the job environment. \nThis includes those who have acquired disability during \ntheir employment with us. Action could encompass making \nfacilities accessible, adjusting work schedules, restructuring \njobs, providing assisting devices or equipment, providing \nreaders or interpreters, and modifying work sites. First \nlaunched in 2012, the form was modified in 2018 to address \nthe requirements of Rights of Persons with Disabilities \n(RPWD) Act 2016.\n\nAwareness\n\nPromoting inclusion in society through industry and contact with \nour customers.\n\n—  observing days of importance, such as World Autism \nAwareness Day, International Day of Sign Languages, Global \nAccessibility Awareness Day, International Day for Persons \nwith Disabilities,\xa0etc.\n\n—  participating in external communities and industry \nforums, such as ASSOChAM (The Associated Chambers \nof Commerce and Industry of India, NCPEDP (National \nCenter for Promotion of Employment for Disabled People),  \nCII-IBDN (The Confederation of Indian Industry – India \nBusiness Disability Network); and\n\n—  supporting our community development partners, including \nSarthak Educational Trust, V-shesh Services, Youth4Jobs \nFoundation, We Are Your Voices Foundation,\xa0etc.\n\nFocus on the United Kingdom\n\nIn 2018, Capgemini UK signed the Time To Change Employer Pledge \ncommitting to building a working environment where employees \nfeel able to talk openly and honestly about mental health and \nknow where to go when seeking help:\n\n—  we have mobilized 135+ Mental health Champions across \nthe UK since 2018, trained by the leading mental health \norganization Mind UK; \n\n—  as well as face-to-face access to our Champions, employees \ncan make contact through our ‘Chat With A Champ’ app, \nwhich was developed during the Covid-19 pandemic; \n\n—  “Thrive” is a confidential wellbeing app approved by the \nUK National health Service. It is available to UK employees \nand helps to build resilience, and prevent and manage \nstress, anxiety and a certain number of other mental health \nconditions tied to professional activity; \n\n—  Capgemini UK has been recognized by Mind on its Workplace \nWellbeing Index at ‘Silver’ level since 2017; and\n\n—  all employees are welcome to join CAPability, our ability and \ncaring network. The objectives of the network are threefold:\n\n– r aise awareness – help everyone become more disability \ninclusive and confident by raising awareness of disability \nand caring matters across the business, \n\n–  support – connect all colleagues through the network to \nhelp people find support and share experiences, \n\n–  feedback – act as a two-way feedback loop on policies \nand practices in relation to disability and careers.\n\nIn 2020, Capgemini UK was re-accredited as a Disability Confident \nEmployer by the UK Government, which recognizes our commitment \nto supporting team members with disabilities. Capgemini UK have \nrecently had a campaign to encourage disclosure of protected \n\ncharacteristics on a voluntary basis and following this campaign, \n712\xa0employees (or 8.9% of the population) confirmed disability or \nlong term health conditions.\n\nFocus on Spain\n\nWith the support of foundations and associations, several training \ncourses have been developed to encourage the hiring of people \nwith disabilities and promote equal employment opportunities.\n\nCapgemini is involved specifically with two initiatives; “CEOs por la \nDiversidad” with Adecco company; and “Empresas por la Equidad, \nDiversidad e Inclusión” (ED&I) with Randstad Foundation. The \nobjective of both initiatives is to generate knowledge, disseminate \nit, and promote business and social awareness of diversity and \nemployment within an organization and with its stakeholders.\n\nIn 2020, continuing to show our commitment to equality and \ndiversity, we worked, for the fifth consecutive year, with the ONCE \nFoundation on the integration of people with disabilities into \nthe workplace through the “PorTalento” and “Crue Scholarships” \nprograms. This year, human resources consulting firm Intrama \nplaced us as one of the TOP30 companies with best practices in \ndiversity, inclusion and equality. We have also been recognized \nas one of the ten most diverse and inclusive companies in Spain \nfor engineering students, according to the Diversity and Inclusion \nIndex prepared by Universum. In parallel, we are continuing our \nefforts to improve in the areas of work-life balance through the \nEFR (Family Responsible Company) certification.\n\nFocus on Poland\n\nCapgemini Poland cooperates with external partners on the inclusion \nof people with disabilities through disability training courses \nfor managers and teams. In 2017, we implemented a disability \ninclusion program called “Win with Capgemini”, aiming to support \nthe employment of people with disabilities, from the recruitment \nstage onward. To optimize integration, we offer technological \nadaptations and assistance from the first day at work. We also \nguarantee the equal treatment of employees with disabilities.\n\nd)  Anti‑discrimination momentum \n\nWherever we operate around the world, we comply not only with \nnational and international labor laws and standards, but also with \nour Group Code of Business Ethics, which promotes diversity and \ninclusion. We adhere to the principles of the fundamental conventions \nof the International Labor Organization and of the Declaration \nof human Rights of 1948, including the United Nations Guiding \nPrinciples on Business and human Rights. We are committed to:\n\n— r ecruiting and retaining talented individuals from diverse \nbackgrounds; \n\n—  treating individuals with fairness and respect; \n—  providing work environments free from any form of \n\nharassment or abuse; \n—  encouraging our employees to maintain a good work-life \n\nbalance; \n—  protecting the health and wellbeing of our staff; and\n—  providing a stable and fair professional environment, where \n\nour employees can develop and thrive.\n\nWe do not tolerate any kind of discrimination, whether direct or \nindirect.\n\nDirect discrimination is when a person is adversely affected by \nbeing treated differently, for example because of their social, \ncultural, ethnic, or national origins, religious or other beliefs, caste, \ngender identity/expression, marital status, pregnancy status, sexual \norientation, disability, age, skin color, ethnicity, parental status, \npolitical ideology, military/veteran status, or trade-union activity.\n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nCorporate, social, and environmental policies and results\n\n152 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n4.\n\nIndirect discrimination is when a rule or condition effectively \nexcludes a significant portion of a group from an activity without \nhaving a valid basis.\n\nOur ethics helpline SpeakUP exists in all the countries where the \nGroup operates, including Altran. The deployment of SpeakUP is \nstill ongoing in two countries (Germany and Morocco), which are \ncurrently using the Raising Concerns Procedure. SpeakUP allows \nemployees to report any type of discrimination. Each SpeakUP alert \nis fairly and thoroughly investigated and may result in disciplinary \naction if the allegation is proven.\n\nRefer to Section\xa04.2.1 for more details about SpeakUP.\n\ne)  Reinforce racial equality measures\n\nAs a Leader for more than 50\xa0years, Capgemini takes pride in a \ndemonstrated commitment to Freedom, Boldness and Team Spirit \n– our core values. It is critical that we take an uncompromising stand \nin support of racial equality and ending discrimination in all its forms \nby creating opportunities and advancement for under-represented \ncommunities at Capgemini.\n\nCapgemini stands against injustice. We promote the value and \nbelief that we are stronger for the diverse perspectives that make \nup our One Capgemini identity. The Group does so at a global level \nbut also through specific country initiatives, described below.\n\nFocus on the United States\n\nThis summer, Capgemini reinforced its commitment to meaningfully \nexpanding inclusion initiatives and launched the Inclusion leadership \nAdvisory Council (ILAC).\n\nWe are dedicated to building an inclusive workplace and attracting \nand retaining a diverse workforce to enable Capgemini and its \nemployees to thrive. We focus on the professional development \nand wellbeing of all our employees with respect and value for their \ndiversity. We aim to attract, develop, and retain talent from various \ndiversity dimensions including disability, geography, age, ethnicity, \nsocial background, gender identity, and expression. In 2020, we \nimproved the percentage of women and underrepresented minorities \nhired, won 2020+ Top Companies for Executive Women, launched \nanother cohort of our Black leadership Development Program for \n64\xa0managers with executive sponsorship for participants, engaged \nemployees in Champion Challenge to define and support Allyship, \nInclusion, and Intersectionality.\n\nWe created our Inclusion leadership Advisory Council to elevate \nexecutive engagement in prioritizing recruitment and representation \nof Black employees across all global grades, advancement of Black \nemployees through career progression and development, cultivating \nan inclusive environment and stewardship. Our Employee Resource \nGroup (ERG) members’ retention rate is 5% higher than the average \nemployee retention rate for the region and the 11\xa0ERGs continue \nto help us mobilize team members including mentoring over 1600 \nstudents including virtual workshops in partnership with TechGirlz \nduring Covid-19 for girls’ grades 5-8\xa0interested in STEM.\n\nOverall, our initiatives are three-fold through ILAC (Inclusion \nleadership Advisory Council):\n\n—  cultivating an inclusive environment: Delivering consistent \nbest practices across all grade levels and hR programs at \nCapgemini. In doing so, we demonstrate that every one of \nour people has the potential to become a future leader and \nfighting unconscious bias;\n\n—  stewardship, career growth & development: Providing \naccess to professional development opportunities for \nunder-represented communities and improving the level \nof representation at each grade level. By ensuring proper \nsponsorship and endorsements, business units can retain \nunder-represented talent longer and encourage more \ndiversity at the Global Grades B through F; and\n\n—  diversity recruitment: Expanding our diversity recruitment \npractices and consistent connection to diverse talent. \nThrough this effort, we strengthen diversity of thought \nand leadership, while promoting the Capgemini brand in \nnew markets and communities. Recruitment leaders across \nthe North America Region, including Business Unit, Global \nBusiness Lines, Financial Services, Sogeti and Invent are \nworking together to improve Capgemini brand awareness \nin diverse communities through recruiting events at select \nhistorically Black colleges and Universities.\n\nFocus on the United Kingdom\n\nThe Black Lives Matter movement sparked a crucial conversation \nin the UK in 2020 about modern racism and what this looks like in \nthe workplace. The UK Country Board, Active Inclusion team and \nRace & Equality Network together built a transparent program to \nembed an anti-racism culture, ensure accountability and action. \nThe Group is a signatory of the UK Business in The Community \norganization’s ‘Race at Work Charter’, highlighting our commitment \nto take practical steps to ensure we are tackling barriers that \nethnic minority people face in recruitment and progression. The \nactions include:\n\n—  supporting our Race & Equality employee network, with \nexecutive sponsorship, and active support of our UK CEO; \n\n—  Anti-Racism training – Provision of ‘Creating A Culture of \nAnti-Racism’ for Global Grades D-F; \n\n— A nti-Racism Reverse mentoring programme (leadership \nteam); \n\n—  creation of an Anti-Racism Pathway in our global LMS system, \n‘Next’, with content curated by our Race & Equality Network; \n\n—  improved ethnicity data through our ‘Include Yourself’ \ninitiative, where employees are invited to share details \nof their ethnicity, and/or other characteristics e.g. sexual \norientation, disability; \n\n—  striving for zero tolerance of harassment and bullying – \nvisibly championed by our UK Country Board, encouraging us \nall to be upstanders not bystanders, and supported by our \nInclusion & Respect ambassador; and\n\n—  supporting ethnic minority career progression in wider \nsociety: from our partnership with Code your Future (100% \nBlack, Asian and Minority Ethnic students, 60% refugees) to \nmentoring with Urban Synergy.\n\nf)  Continue the development of LGBTQA+\n\nThe LGBTQA+ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and \nAllies) inclusion efforts at Capgemini, are primarily governed and \nstrategically developed by the Employee Resource Group (ERG) \nOUTfront. OUTfront’s mission is to provide a forum for education \nand awareness supporting the professional growth of LGBTQA+ \nindividuals by fostering a safe environment globally for people to \nbe authentic in the workplace.\n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nCorporate, social, and environmental policies and results\n\nCAPGEMINI 153\n\n4.\n\nCurrently, OUTfront is operating in 17\xa0countries (United States, \nCanada, Mexico, Brazil, United Kingdom, France, Spain, Germany, \nSwitzerland, Austria, Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, \nFinland, Australia, India) across the Capgemini landscape. OUTfront \nis primarily a volunteer group, with passionate people working \nalongside hR and CSR partners.\n\nWorking in parallel to OUTfront in the regions is OUTfront Global. \nOUTfront Global is comprised of four volunteer consultants who \nran these workstreams in 2020:\n\n—  Governance: OUTfront Global facilitated 6-week All-hands \nmeetings to share regional updates and special topics. \nOUTfront Global also holds one-on-one meetings with \nregional leads to discuss strategy, goals, issues, or concerns. \nOUTfront Global uses the time to better assist the regions \nand has maintained this high-touch approach throughout \n2020. OUTfront Global also started utilizing the MS Teams \npage to publish regional events, questions and content. \nThis has become an eficient method for OUTfront Global to \nview regional progress and assess where it can best direct its \nefforts as it is a resource to the regions.\n\n—  Strategy: OUTfront Global developed an Employee Resource \nGroup toolkit for regions to easily kick start an OUTfront ERG. \nThe document is a 40+ page guide that sets out the benefits \nof an ERG, roles and responsibilities, launch checklists, \ngovernance plans, communications do’s and don’ts, LGBT+ \npartner resources,\xa0etc. This toolkit is just one example of the \nofferings OUTfront Global has developed to establish and \nsupport upcoming regions. OUTfront continuously meets \nwith hR and CSR partners to launch new OUTfront networks. \nThe OUTfront Global team works with the partners to \nprovide established artifacts for Business Cases or Country \nBoard presentation.\n\n—  Marketing: OUTfront celebrated IDAhOBIT (International \nDay Against homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia) and \nPride through global internal and external communication \ncampaigns. For IDAhOBIT in 2020, Capgemini published a \n“Join hands and Celebrate Love” campaign with internal \ntalent articles, external blog posts and flashcards for \nregions to share their message of committing to diversity. \nIn 2020, Pride was celebrated globally with social media \nchallenges, video messages and virtual parades. We also had \nthree exciting network launches in France, Spain and the \nNetherlands. Also, notable mention to Capgemini Brazil and \nCapgemini Mexico for celebrating their first Pride events.\n\nOUTfront Global strategically levels up the regional networks \nwith special development topics and events, such as our global \nOUTfront Accelerated Solution Environment (ASE) Summit. This \nevent spanned 10\xa0hours over two days, where 40+ leads virtually met \nto develop our 2021 Initiative Charters. We discussed what it’s like \nto be an LGBT+ or Ally leader at a global company, the benefits of \nOUTfront and how to envision a future of success for the network.\n\nRecent Recognition\n\n—  In India: Top Companies for 21\xa0days Global Ally Challenge for \nLGBTQ+ by Pride Circle; \n\n—  in North America: Best Places to Work for LGBTQ Equality by \nhuman Rights Campaign; and\n\n—  in Australia:\n–  Best employer for Women (5\xa0stars out of 5) by Brigitte; \n–  Top 3 – Gold Employer Status for LGBTQ+ by Australian \n\nWorkplace Equality Index (AWEI) Virtual Awards.\n\n \n\nBreakdown of workforce by year of service and by \nage: changes in 2018-2020\n\nThe change to average length of service testifies to the Group’s \ndynamism in terms of recruitment in recent years: the number \nof new hires, which exceeded 60,000\xa0two years in a row in 2018 \nand 2019, dropped significantly in 2020 due to the Covid-19 crisis. \nNonetheless, it exceeded 47,000\xa0hires. This high flow of external \nhires over the last three years explains the high proportion of \nemployees with less than three years of service – 52.8% before \nAltran and 53.6% including Altran.\n\nIn 2020, the average length of service in the Group increased \nto 4.98\xa0years (4.58\xa0years in 2019) on a Capgemini legacy scope. \nThis average covers geographical disparities, from 3\xa0to 4\xa0years in \nAsia-Pacific, LatAm and MEA, driven by India, (where most of the \nrecruitment took place) compared to 9.6\xa0years in Benelux, 8.2\xa0years \nin France or 7.5\xa0years in UK. Within Altran, the average seniority is \nclose, at 4.44\xa0years and the overall Group seniority is at 4.88\xa0years.\n\nWhen there is an acquisition, length of service is calculated from \nthe employee’s hire date in the acquired company, not the date \nof their incorporation in Capgemini.\n\nThe data refers to 99.9% of the consolidated headcount as at 31\xa0December.\n\n< 1 year\n\n10\n\n40\n\n35\n\n30\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n5\n\nDecember 2018 (C)\n\nDecember 2019 (C)\n\nDecember 2020 (C)\n\nDecember 2020 (C+A)\n\n16.6%\n\n25.7%25.8%\n\n16.6%\n\n10 years and more\n\n14.1%\n13.2%\n\n14.4% 14.6%\n\n5-9 years\n\n15.4%14.6%14.9% 15.4%\n\n3-4 years\n\n16.9%\n15.4%14.8%\n\n17.1%\n\n1-2 years\n\n37.0%\n\n31.1%\n30.2%\n\n36.2%\n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nCorporate, social, and environmental policies and results\n\n154 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n4.\n\nThe data refers to 99.7% of the consolidated headcount as at 31\xa0December.\n\n< 20-24 years\n\n50\n\n40\n\n45\n\n30\n\n35\n\n20\n\n25\n\n10\n\n5\n\n15\n\nDecember 2018 (C)\n\nDecember 2019 (C)\n\nDecember 2020 (C)\n\nDecember 2020 (C+A)\n\n12.2%\n14.6%15.0%\n\n13.2%\n\n55 years and more\n\n4.4%4.4%4.3% 4.58%\n\n45-54 years\n\n10.7%10.2%9.9% 10.65%\n\n35-44 years\n\n25.4%24.5%23.7%\n25.3%\n\n25-34 years\n\n47.4%\n46.2%47.1% 46.3%\n\nScope: (C) stands for Capgemini legacy, (A) stands for Altran legacy and (C+A) for Capgemini and Altran\n\nAge is rounded at superior decimal value (e.g.: an employee of \n24,6\xa0years on 31/12/2020 will be accounted in the 25-34\xa0years range).\n\nThe average age of employees increased this year and stood at \n34.4 (+0.9\xa0year). This is due to (i)\xa0the average age of the Altran \npopulation being slightly higher by 0.6\xa0year, and (ii)\xa0a reduced level \nof hiring resulting from the Covid-19 crisis, as a significant number \nof recruits are young graduates. In addition, attrition was reduced \nsignificantly, driving the average age up naturally. The average age \nin India has gone up above 30\xa0to 30.9\xa0on the consolidated basis and \nhas gone up by 0.9\xa0year on the Capgemini legacy basis.\n\nThe share of employees under the age of 35\xa0 is down slightly \nto 59.5% (-1.3\xa0point) with a marginal impact of Altran on the \nconsolidated number.\n\nIndia remains amongst the youngest countries in average, along \nwith Romania and Morocco (both under 30) and with China and \nGuatemala, while the UK, North America, Switzerland, Nordic \ncountries (Finland, Sweden and Denmark) and the Netherlands \nhave an average age between 40 and 43.\n\n4.1.1.3  Talent brand & attractiveness\n\nThe Capgemini brand has been built on the idea that people are our \n“Ace of Spades” – our greatest asset and the highest-value card in \nour hand. We work with some of the largest and most-recognized \nbrands in the world. Time and again, our clients tell us that it is our \n\npeople that set us apart from the competition. We naturally strive \nto hire the best talents, but it is the opportunities we offer that \nenable them to flourish in their roles and become difference makers \nfor some of the world’s biggest companies. Our people and their \nexperiences build our “talent brand”, showcase us as an employer \nof choice in the market and make it an attractive proposition for \ntop talent to work with us.\n\nPolicies and Actions\n\na)  Glassdoor: An authentic talent brand view of the \n“Capgemini Experience”\n\nIn today’s digital age, the talent brand is influenced by portals like \nGlassdoor, which provides an open view of what it’s like working \nwith Capgemini to the external audience. In the past two years, \nwe have worked with the business and hR teams to leverage our \ntransformational talent, learning and experience programs to help \nimprove how people perceive our brand and make it authentic. \nOur global scores on Glassdoor steadily improved from 3.3 in \nDecember\xa02019 to 3.9 (on a scale from 1\xa0to 5, with 5\xa0being the \nhighest score) as of year-end 2020. Countries like India, where we \nhave half of our talent, reached a market benchmark of 4.0, making \nus one of the top IT services company with the highest rating on \nGlassdoor among our peers.\n\nThe figures below cover the Capgemini legacy scope.\n\nOverall \nRating\n\nCulture & \nValues\n\nWork Life \nBalance\n\nSenior \nMana‑\n\ngement\n\nCompen‑\nsation and \nBenefits\n\nGrowth – \nCareer  \n\nPath\n\nDiversity \nand \n\nInclusion\nCEO \n\nRatings\n\nPositive \nBusiness \nOutlook\n\nRecom‑\nmend to  \na Friend\n\nInterview \nExperience\n\n3.9 4 3.8 3.6 3.4 3.9 4.2 95% 71% 83% 73%\n\nb)  The digital talent engagement & hiring accelerator – \nLinkedIn\n\nhiring channels have evolved over the years thanks to the digital \nwave. LinkedIn, which has over 722\xa0million members in 200+ \ncountries, has become one of the key channels for attracting, \nengaging and hiring at Capgemini. For experienced hires, it is now \nthe top channel through which our recruiting teams receive most \napplications and make hires. A digital channel like LinkedIn gives \ncandidates access to our in-house sourcing and recruiting teams \nto connect for job opportunities and to build engagement for \ntalent pooling. In the “talent war” and digital skills gap scenario, \nLinkedIn plays a critical role for us to identify and hire the niche \nskills in digital/cybersecurity/cloud/data we need for competitive \nadvantage. Over the years, through structured learning and \ncertification programs, we have upskilled our recruiters to enable \nthem to leverage the latest recruiting tools. It is also proven that \n\nhires from these channels grow and stay longer with us compared \nto other recruiting sources.\n\nc)  Transforming with artificial intelligence & virtual hiring\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has been empowering our recruitment \nprocess in India. We have enabled an AI matching engine and a \nchatbot to improve both the eficiency of our recruiting funnel \nand the quality of candidates, as well as to improve the candidate \nexperience. The AI matching enables our recruiting teams to focus \non being consultants to our business, leaving the automation tool \nto match candidates with open roles.\n\nOur India campus hiring program for technical hires was transformed \ndigitally under the name “Capgemini Exceller”. Post pandemic, \n100% of our campus hiring was transitioned digitally through an \nonline platform that enabled online engagement, assessment \nand selection, along with strengthening our university relations.\n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nCorporate, social, and environmental policies and results\n\nCAPGEMINI 155\n\n4.\n\nd)  Digital onboarding – first experience delivered digitally\n\nWe understand the importance of the first few days for our \nnew joiners and the business. All our entities develop employee \nintegration programs (training, formal events,\xa0etc.), in accordance \nwith the Group’s guidelines and requirements. The “new normal”, \namong all the other challenges, provided us with the opportunity \nto transform the onboarding experience. This is the first critical \nstep for our new employees, where they get a first-hand view of \nour culture, people and business.\n\nOur Invent team has designed a “VP (Vice-President) Journey” \nSharePoint portal, which supports newly onboarded leaders to \nunderstand our culture, connect with fellow team members, \naccess tools and documents, connect with a buddy/mentor, and \nstart exploring development opportunity. The entire journey is \nenabled through MS Teams and SharePoint, along with frequent \ninteractions. The objective is to welcome new leaders, build \nconsistency in our onboarding approach and provide guidance as \nnecessary throughout their journey.\n\nAll our newly promoted and newly hired VPs are invited to participate \nin the Group’s ONE onboarding program within their first year, an \nopportunity for a privileged connection with peers globally and \nto get closer to the Group’s ambition.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, our teams have worked to bring the \nonboarding experience digitally to new joiners. We want our new \njoiners to feel welcome and ready to hit the ground running. We \nhave a three-step process for virtual onboarding:\n\n—  step 1: Our BeReady portal enables new team members to \nstart becoming familiar with Capgemini and our processes \nbefore joining. The portal allows interaction between team \nmembers and the wider business and is the first step to \nbuilding a Capgemini network; \n\n—  step 2: Once a new team member has become familiar with \ntheir new equipment, they will be invited to our virtual \ninteractive BeInspired Induction session; and\n\n— st ep 3: MyCapgemini portal facilitates the admin and document \ncollation process for the new employees.\n\ne)  External awards & recognition\n\nOur talent brand is empowered by our people and their experiences. \nIt has been recognized as one of the best employer brands across \ndifferent countries/regions. This is a reflection of our investment \nin attracting, growing and retaining the top talent as we strive to \nbecome a place where talent thrives. Our many awards include \n(not an exhaustive list):\n\n—  Best Places to work award for Germany and the UK – 2020; \n—  Great Places to work – Capgemini Portugal, Germany; \n—  Best Apprentice Attraction Campaign Award at the \n\nRateMyApprenticeship Awards in the UK; \n—  Top Employer 2020 – Poland; \n—  Gold status at the Australian Workplace Equality Index \n\n(AWEI); \n—  Best Companies for Millennials Awards – India; \n—  Universum The Most Attractive Employers – Students rank \n\n50 (Germany); and\n—  Experienced consultants in IT engineering (France).\n\nExternal Hiring\n\nGiven the range and volume of our recruiting, a multichannel \napproach is necessary:\n\n— t he Group defines the content, concept and rules of our brand \nimage with the Marketing & Communication departments; \n\n—  recruitment campaigns and advertising are approved by the \noperational units and comply with the Group’s standards; \n\n—  the talent brand and the underlying employer promise is \nreflected locally and globally in our recruiting process. These \nactivities are coordinated by the local human Resources \nteams, in the operational units and local Marketing \n& Communication departments and can mobilize the \nexperience and support of the Group’s human Resources \nrecruitment team.\n\nNew hires include employees who joined Capgemini after the usual \nrecruitment process during the financial year and who are part of \nthe headcount (new hires incorporated via acquisitions/operations \nare excluded).

India saw its net \nheadcount increase further following the acquisition of Altran, \nas well as organically, welcoming more than 15,700\xa0additional \nemployees in 2020. Both Europe and the Americas reported an \norganic headcount reduction.\n\nThe “Promote first, Hire second” principle ensures internal candidates \ndisplaying development potential are given priority over external \ncandidates regarding career development and new position openings. \nPublishing vacancies and internal job opportunities (if applicable) \nand reviewing various candidates with the human Resources teams \nfor each Strategic Business Unit/Global Business Line are standard \nrequirements before turning to external recruitment.\n\nRegarding senior hires, every Vice-President hired undergoes an \nexternal assessment (different from the one carried out by the \nrecruiting body).\n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nCorporate, social, and environmental policies and results\n\n156 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n4.\n\nResults and Key Performance Indicators (KPI)\n\n KPI 2017 2018 2019 2020 \n\nScope C C C C+A \n\nTalent attractiveness Number of people hired by the Group (external hiring) 52,299 61,752 63,728 47,002 √ \n\nImplementation of local \ninitiatives preventing the \nunwanted departure of \nemployees\n\nEmployee voluntary attrition rate (%) (1)  \n\nTotal attrition rate (%) (1)  \n\n18.9\n\n23.2\n\n22\n\n25.8\n\n20\n\n25.9\n\n12.8 √ \n\n18.5 \n\n \n\nScope: (C) stands for Capgemini legacy, (A) stands for Altran legacy and (C+A) for Capgemini and Altran.\n√ Data identified in these tables by a √ has been reviewed by Mazars with a reasonable level of assurance.\n(1) Note: Numbers for 2017 to 2019 are covering Capgemini legacy only, excluding Altran.\n\n4.1.1.4  Continuous learning & development:  \nright skills and opportunities\n\nAt Capgemini, turning potential into value sits at the center of \nour Learning and Development efforts. We believe in the power \nof our people and the vital role we play in their development, \nensuring their sustainability and long-term employability as their \ncareers progress through our company and beyond. To meet the \nincreasingly agile expectations of our clients and our people, every \nCapgemini employee, from fresh hires right out of university to \nsenior leadership, can expect the same high standard of tools, \nprograms and support (tailored to their roles, skills and path \nprogression) as they develop in their careers.\n\na)  Performance Management \n\nCapgemini has a robust performance management model in place \nso that every employee has:\n\n—  clear objectives established early in the year; \n—  a year-end performance review (at the minimum); and\n— a  once-a-year development discussion.\n\nWhile this Group minimum standard usually sees a richer application \nin the businesses (with additional mid-year reviews and more \nthan once a year promotion opportunities), since 2018 the Group \nhas engaged in the design and piloting of a new performance \nmanagement model called “Perform”. Destined to primarily respond \nto our entry and young professional grades (that represent the \nmajority of our workforce), the Perform model addresses their \nchanging expectations as well as the need to better support the \nagile business environment in which the Group operates.\n\nPerform is a more continuous system focusing on progression \nrather than on just past performance by:\n\n— c larifying a standard and limited set of development needs/\nobjectives by role and grade; \n\n—  evidencing attainment through continuous, 360-degree \nfeedback via co-workers, managers, partners and clients; \n\n—  running quick and effective value assessments by the People \nManager; and\n\n—  reviewing promotion decisions in quarterly People Review \nroundtables.\n\nWhile our management and top leader levels are remaining on a \nsemi-annual or annual cycle, the Perform model will:\n\n— a pply to them the same standard development objectives \n(by role and grade); \n\n—  fully include them to actively take part (giving and receiving) \nin the targeted feedback culture; and\n\n—  require an even stronger focus on people development and \nrole modelling.\n\nThis model will allow for an easier adjustment of goals on an ongoing \nbasis. It will supplement standard development with tailor-made \noptions for faster upskilling and supporting mobility options.\n\nMore than 12,000\xa0employees have been enrolled in pilots across \nthe Group over the past 18\xa0months (notably in France, Netherlands, \nNorth America and India) that validated the value of the model. It \nis now planned for a Group-wide rollout.\n\nAltran has a similar annual performance management model and \nwill fully align to the Perform approach.\n\nb)  Next – unified experience platform for learning\n\nDigital learning has been a hot business topic for a long time. \nhowever, there has never been a greater need for well designed \nand implemented digital skills solutions to maintain high quality \ndelivery and allay employee worries about skill redundancy in an \nincreasingly volatile market.\n\nCapgemini has partnered with some of the world’s leading Learning \nand Development content providers, such as Pluralsight, harvard \nManagementor, harvard Spark, and Coursera, to create the Next \ndigital learning platform, powered by Degreed. Next was developed \nas a one-stop-shop for our disparate learning platforms, launched \nwell ahead of schedule in the first half of the year, to address new \nskills-based learning needs which can no longer be handled face \nto face. Next gives all Capgemini learners access to 250,000+ \ncourses and 3\xa0 million learning activities from 1,200\xa0 sources, \nempowering them to fully customize and optimize their individual \nlearning journey. All development activities on Next are recognized \ninternally. Many are also externally recognized, with numerous \ncourses from renowned and accredited universities and many \nexternal certifications available free of charge.\n\nAs of the end of 2020, Next has 158,398\xa0active users, which is 75% \nof Group headcount (excluding Altran). It is rapidly shifting the \n‘learning hour’ landscape when compared to 2019.\n\nc)  Growing the learning ecosystem with partners and \ncertifications\n\nThe launch of Next has facilitated the rapid growth of our learning \necosystem. This has meant that the learning content from our partners \n(such as Microsoft, SAP, AWS, Redhat, Oracle, Salesforce,\xa0etc.), \nwhom we rely on to gain the skills necessary to bring innovation \nto our clients on their terms, has been pushed to the forefront of \ndevelopment. Partner content is featured on the front page of \nNext, seen immediately by all employees, and has driven a marked \nuptick in skills development and certification. Next has also enabled \nus to digitize and deploy a variety of academies, guided learning \npathways that act as a hub for those acquiring particular skills.\n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nCorporate, social, and environmental policies and results\n\nCAPGEMINI 157\n\n4.\n\nAI Academy on Next is a good example of this. AI Academy is \ngeared towards increasing the base level of data and AI intelligence \nacross the entire organization, as well as furthering the skills of our \nPractitioner and Professional (those skilled in data engineering, \ndata science, machine learning and data visualization) populations. \nAI Academy gives our people a clear learning-driven path for all AI \nroles within Capgemini, as well as a community of peers with whom \nto learn. The Academy has several tracks (AI for Management, AI \nfor Solutioning, AI for Delivery,\xa0etc.) to fit the needs of every AI \nlearner at every stage of their career progression. As of the end \nof 2020, 6,415\xa0users had identified AI as a new skill and 921\xa0users \nwere taking AI training, an increase of 14.36% of employees with \nthe AI skill (these figures cover Capgemini legacy only).\n\nNext also allows us to boost more focused partner content, such as \nwith our Microsoft Technical Learning pathway. Microsoft underpins \nthe majority of the Group’s priority offers, which means that having \nup to date knowledge on all products, services, certifications and \nrelated skills is key. This led us to a blended learning approach using \na combination of digital learning on Next, instructor-led training, \nwebinars and up-skilling events to develop our specialists and \nhelp them get certified in Cloud, Modern Desktop and Business \nApplications (Power BI, Dynamics 365). In 2020, this program included \n6,132\xa0unique participants on Next, 16,500\xa0attendees at the Cloud \nWeek event, 19,066\xa0unique participants across instructor led and \nwebinar sessions, all leading to 3,088\xa0new Microsoft certifications \n(these figures cover Capgemini legacy only).\n\nBeyond Next, the partner ecosystem allows us to offer our \nemployees market ready skills from the start of their career. L’École \nby Capgemini, for example, is a recruitment and development \nprogram for the first months of a new joiner’s time with Capgemini \nin France. This enables them to learn business, leadership and tech \nskills through partners like SAP, Salesforce and various renowned \nbusiness schools.\n\nLikewise, the “Fullstack Engineer” program in the cloud infrastructure \nservices Global Business Lines expands team capabilities to multiple \nIT/networks stacks for the business, enabling better identification \nof key resources and more effective and eficient resource planning. \nThis improves delivery efficiency by using multi-competency \nresources and will, in turn, enable more competitive pricing to \nour clients. For team members, this means a more valuable profile \nwith clear career paths and increased growth opportunities. It \nalso allows us to offer highly varied, interesting, and fulfilling \nwork. There are currently five technology stacks, each one with \nmultiple sub-technology topics, and each topic has three levels of \nproficiency: beginner, intermediate and advanced. This program is \nsupported by Pluralsight through the Next platform.\n\nWe also have our own internal certifications and accreditations, \nwhich for many years have been, and remain today, an important \nasset and a recognition for the expertise and development paths \nfor key roles and communities. For example, the Engagement \nManager Certification covering roles such as Project Managers, \nScrum Masters, Service Delivery Managers and Transition \nManagers is a levelled certification program (from Foundation \nto Level\xa04\xa0Expert). This global certification scheme allows better \nstafing of complex and specific engagements with the appropriate \nlevel of expertise and represents a strong community with elevated \nexcellence standards. There is an equivalent for the Architecture \ncommunity and the Account Management community. These strategic \ncommunities are part of the 15\xa0professional communities that are \nrun across our Group.\n\nd)  Digital, virtual and hybrid events\n\nAs a response to Covid-19, all events in 2020 shifted online. Not \nbeing limited by a physical location allowed significantly more \nparticipants to take part in learning events, creating more community \nconnections, and fostering a sense of belonging to their learning \ncommunities and Capgemini as a whole. Two learning events, \n\ndesigned from the ground-up as digital rather than converted \nfrom a physical event, stand out:\n\n—  “InventX” was a 5-week asynchronous virtual event that \noccurred each Friday for Capgemini’s consultant population. \nThis used the ‘hopin’ virtual event platform to achieve a \nfestival mindset complete with headliners, area stages, your \nown learning path and choices of broadcast experiences. \nThe event featured 108\xa0speakers delivering 114\xa0sessions for \nnearly 3,000\xa0unique attendees (6\xa0times more than the same \nevent delivered face-to-face previously); and\n\n— “Architects Summit” was another 5-day event (although \nhosted all in one week) for Capgemini’s architects and \ntech specialists. It was also the first event featuring over \n300\xa0 participants from Altran following its acquisition. The \nevent reached 4,500\xa0 people, 9\xa0 times as many participants \nas the same event held face-to-face the previous year, all of \nwhom focused on different aspects of personal, business \nand social growth.\n\ne)  Manager development\n\nThis year saw significant investment in further developing \nCapgemini’s manager and aspiring manager population via the \nglobal “Connected Manager” program. Connected Manager is \naimed at middle management, evolving the managerial mindset \nas well as behaviors and practices necessary for success. The \nprogram follows the 3P principle (Proximity, Performance and \nPerspective – bringing people together into one community as \nthey build the skills they need in context). We will continue to \nexpand it in the future. Originally a hybrid program, Connected \nManager has made the jump to 100% virtual, allowing the program \nto rapidly expand. To date, the program is present in 40\xa0countries \nwith 16,500\xa0participants. 6,500\xa0of whom have completed their \ncertifications (these figures cover Capgemini legacy only).\n\nf)  Executive learning \n\nRevamping the learning culture to take advantage of digital must \nbegin from the top, which is why 2020 saw significant progress in \nexecutive education offerings. To develop strong digital leaders, \nwe created the Executive Education Section on the Next digital \nlearning platform. This provides both recommended and individualized \nlearning paths for experienced managers and leaders, with content \nsuch as enhancing business and tech leadership, role-modelling \nnew ways of working and collaboration, enhancing people coaching \nand development capabilities, and how to drive innovation and \ntransformation.\n\nThe executive learning offering was further extended to include \nan external coaching approach that our executives can leverage to \ndevelop specific skills or career options. This is based on the principle \nthat learning goes through different modalities at different career \nstages and person-to-person support is an effective and impactful \nway for our senior talent to progress. We have proof-tested four \nworld-class coaching organizations and have made them available \nto all entities to choose the most relevant ones for supporting \nthese special talent pools. Each executive can then develop and \nimprove at their own pace – on the topics at hand – and through \nthe most relevant approach.\n\ng)  Talent acceleration and high potential development\n\nOur Leadership Development Programs are designed to allow every \nemployee to improve their leadership skills, with explicit requirements \nfor specific grades. Vice-Presidents are assessed annually on their \nbehavior and leadership skills during their performance review. We \noffer a selection of acceleration and development programs for \nemployees with high potential – within each grade – to boost the \nprogress of specific profiles and thus accelerate their career. We \nalso offer a selection of Leadership Development Programs aimed \nat highflyers – within each grade – to train employees and align \nhabits and behaviors with expected leadership skills.\n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nCorporate, social, and environmental policies and results\n\n158 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n4.\n\nFor a longer-term approach, we also focused on our E.L.I.T.E program, \na brand-new concept providing a launch pad for our future leaders. \nThis program focuses on hiring top talents out of Tier 1\xa0business \nschools in India and placing them on a ten-year track to senior \nmanagement as they explore new ideas and solve key business \nchallenges across a broad spectrum of roles and functions. E.L.I.T.E. \nincludes exposure to a consistent set of onboarding activities, \nrotation projects, international contacts, extra-curricular projects \nand events, community building, and Learning and Development. \nFollowing the program launch, 95% of remaining participants \nhave been promoted, with a strong 48% gender diversity making \na clear impact across business units and functions (these figures \ncover Capgemini legacy only).\n\nThe eligibility and enrolment conditions for these programs are \nupdated every year and their students receive specific support as \nthey progress within the Group.\n\nh)  Workforce planning and skills development\n\nAt Capgemini, careers and skills are at the core of business, hence \nmaking sure that ‘the right person with the right skill is in the right \njob at the right moment’. Our global stafing tool is designed to \nharness the business demand, skills, people data and project mobility \nchoices to map the pool of interested talent profiles against the \nright demand. This is further leveraged by our resource planners to \nmake decisions about stafing. The tool offers a global marketplace, \nwhere people can express their interest in projects that have been \nchosen to be published rather than having a resource assigned \ndirectly. Any unfulfilled demand is flagged to the external market, \nin line with our core stafing principle to ‘look internally before \ngoing to the market’. The analytics engine is designed to grow in \nintelligence through a skills framework, taxonomy, professional \ncommunities, and evolving people data, so that it increases the \nmatching ability, understands career choices, and reduces the \nturnaround time and business costs involved.\n\nResults and Key Performance Indicators (KPI)\n\n KPI Scope 2018 2019 2020 \n\nTraining policy Total number of training hours  \n(millions of hours) (1) (2)  \n\nC\nA (3)  \n\n8.2 9.2 9.8\n1.1 \n\nAverage number of training hours per employee (2)  C\nA (3)  \n\n38.8 41.9 45.5 √\n22.2 \n\nDevelopment of  \ninternal talent\n\nNumber of consultants and senior consultants  \n(A and B grades) onboarded in the new  \nPerformance Management System (Pilot phase) (2)  \n\nC 8,720 12,000 12,000 \n\nPortfolio of training and \ntalent acceleration  \nprograms for highflyers\n\nNumbers of employees enrolled in talent  \nacceleration programs (2)  \n\nC 907 1,060 2,180 \n\nScope: (C) stands for Capgemini legacy, (A) stands for Altran legacy and (C+A) for Capgemini and Altran.\n√ Data identified in these tables by a √ has been reviewed by Mazars with a reasonable level of assurance.\n(1) Note: There has been a change in methodology in how learning hours are reported from 2018 to 2019. Only training completed in full by our employees was considered in \n\nthe scope of calculation. Until 2018, even partially completed training was considered. Also, reported hours cover employees still present on December\xa031st\xa0of the relevant \nyear. 2018 and 2019 data was recalculated for comparability purposes.\n\n(2) Note: These numbers cover Capgemini legacy only, excluding Altran scope. They therefore cover 81.5% of the total Group’s headcount.\n(3) Coverage rate of Altran training information: 98,4% of Altran headcount.\n\n4.1.1.5  Leadership\n\nCapgemini’s leadership is at the core of driving business strategy, \nnavigating the complexities of our business environments, identifying \nand defining the transformation levers with our clients, and aligning \npeople behind a common mindset, behaviors, ambitions and goals. \nIn addition to the specific leadership development mentioned in the \nprevious Sections, Capgemini has implemented fair and integrated \nprocesses to ensure we identify, promote, expose, and develop \nour leaders for larger opportunities. Grooming our Top Talent for \nfuture leadership positions and capabilities is a long-term effort \nleveraging multiple drivers.\n\nPolicies and Actions\n\na)  leadership Model and Vice‑President (VP) processes\n\n The Group’s leadership model establishes a clear set of leadership \ncapabilities for ensuring success at Capgemini. It is based on six \ndimensions:\n\n1.  “La Niaque” (Grit, Resolve and Resilience); \n2.  Business builder; \n3.  Profit shaper; \n4.  People developer;\n5.  Agile player; and\n6. A ctive connector.\n\n  \n\nThis leadership model is applicable to all grade levels across the \nGroup, and actively applied and enforced at VP level. Each grade \nis split into four levels. This enables us to establish employees’ \nmaturity within their grade, set expectations, and enable fair \nevaluations across all our businesses. The drivers and behavioral \nexpectations for leadership, as described in our group model, are \ntranslated into both promotion and recruitment processes at the \nhighest leadership levels in the organization:\n\n—  Director and Vice-President (VP) promotion process; \n—  VP external assessment during recruitment process.\n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nCorporate, social, and environmental policies and results\n\nCAPGEMINI 159\n\n4.\n\nFor seniority below director and VP level, the countries and businesses \nare responsible for leveraging the model within their respective \ntalent processes, ensuring that this model is relayed at local levels.\n\nb)  VP Strategic Talent Review (STR) – succession & mobility\n\nCapgemini runs a formal Strategic Talent Review (STR) of its VP \nand director population at Business Units/Function and country \nlevels as well as Group level, with the ultimate objective to identify \nthe best leader talents – current and future:\n\n—  identify options and preparation steps for succession plans \nand mobility moves; and\n\n—  drive leadership development.\n\nFormal business and country leadership roundtables ensure that \nthe top talent strategies and actions adopted are followed through.\n\nc)  Group Position Holders\n\nThe Group Executive Board has created a next-in-line Group Position \nholders with a twofold objective:\n\n—  build a high-performance Group leadership culture wherein \nthe Group Position holders’ contributions and accountability \nare not confined to their respective Business Units/Functions, \nbut can extend to the entire Capgemini group; and\n\n—  create a global leadership capital to realize the Group \nstrategy by nurturing leadership potential, facilitating global \nmobility and succession planning.\n\nBased on the business and market context and conditions, the \nGroup Executive Board has defined strategic criteria to identifying \nthese Group positions. These criteria undergo a revision every year \nto adjust to both present realities and the future. One of the key \ncriteria is to rotate holders of these positions every five years.\n\n4.1.1.6  Health, safety, and wellbeing at work\n\nWe safeguard the health, safety and wellbeing of our employees \nand sub-contractors – be it in the workplace, working from client \nsites or from home, and while travelling. During the pandemic, the \nhealth and Safety of our people were of special importance to us \nwith the sudden and large-scale shift to remote work.\n\nPolicies and Actions\n\na)  Health and Safety at work\n\nBeing a people centric company, the health and Safety of our \nemployees is always of highest importance for us. That’s why, even \nduring the pandemic, we have continued to update, upgrade and \ncommunicate our policies. Information on health and Safety is \nprovided to all employees, regular training is promoted to keep \npeople’s reactions sharp in case of incidents and to prepare them \nto handle emergency situations. Employees who have received first \naid and emergency training are thus able to provide an adequate \nresponse in the event of an emergency. Support through third \nparties is offered for work-life balance, disability and rehabilitation, \nas well as during business travel.\n\nThe following is an overview of the scope of our regular health \nand Safety policies, which provide information, guidelines and \ntraining for all employees:\n\n—  health & Safety in our ofices; \n—  health & Safety on external sites and while travelling;\n\n—  handling of accidents and emergencies; \n—  handling of hazardous substances (also part of our \n\nEnvironmental Management System); \n—  guidelines and training for safe travel; \n—  initiatives to promote a healthy lifestyle and mental health; \n—  training and information on ergonomics; \n—  guidelines for sickness and rehabilitation; and\n—  guidelines for employees with disabilities.\n\nAltran is also committed to ensuring the health and Safety of \nits employees in accordance with national and European Union \nlegislation and directives, and has defined Occupational health \nand Safety and occupational risk assessment policies at the level \nof each country. Risks related to the Company’s activities are \nclassified as generic risks, specific risks, risks related to the working \nenvironment and psychosocial risks:\n\n—  generic risks concern all employees, particularly in connection \nwith travel and work assignments; \n\n—  specific risks depend on the activity of the engineers and the \nsectors and clients with which they work (ionizing radiation, \nCMR and biological agents,\xa0etc.); \n\n—  risks related to the work environment concern the \nworkstation, premises and emergency situations; and\n\n—  psychosocial risks are those elements that affect the physical \nintegrity and mental health of employees within their work \nenvironment.\n\nIn 2020, the Group continued to provide training for managers \nand internal awareness campaigns on the risks of falls and those \nassociated with working on screens.\n\nWhile the world was challenged by Covid-19 in 2020, even more \nfocus was put on the health and Safety of everyone working at \nCapgemini and Altran. The global crisis team in which all functions \nare represented developed ‘Covid-19 health & Safety Guidelines’, \nwhich were deployed globally. In a very short timeframe, consistent \nsafety protocols were developed and a ‘Covid-19 Ofice Etiquette’ \nfor our Capgemini and Altran ofices implemented.\n\n—  as per World health Organization (WhO) guidelines and local \nmedical health and Safety practices, regular hygiene and \nspecific disinfection protocols on our premises are in place. \nAll protocols have been intensively communicated with \ne-learnings, videos, Q&A sessions, posters, flyers, intranet \npublications and emails to ensure all our people are aware \nof them; \n\n—  international travel was restricted to business critical only. \nTravel guidelines are continually reviewed and updated; \n\n—  a comprehensive, organization-wide awareness campaign \nwas rolled out to inform and educate all Capgemini \nemployees about safety measures and prescribed dos and \ndon’ts; \n\n—  masks have been provided to all sites to be handed out to \npeople working on site or travelling and commuting; \n\n—  social distancing norms are being adhered to in our all \nofices, including staggered lunch hours and designated \nseating spaces; \n\n— t he safety of all sites is regularly reviewed to ensure the duty \nof care for people on site during the pandemic; and\n\n—  in addition to the above measures, we have enabled most \nof our colleagues across the globe to work from home \neffectively.\n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nCorporate, social, and environmental policies and results\n\n160 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n4.\n\nb)  Health and Safety with our external partners\n\nMany of our colleagues regularly work on clients’, subcontractors’ \nor other non-Capgemini sites. To account for the growing need \nfor flexibility at work, it is important to extend the coverage of \nour health and Safety information to external premises, such as \ntrains, planes, homes and hotels.\n\nAt client sites we ensure that our employees are aware of and \ncooperate with the health, safety and emergency rules on site. \nDuring the Covid-19 crisis, employees rapidly moved to a Work \nfrom home (WFh) model, enabling us to actively avoid further \nspreading the virus and in line with our Duty of Care to our \npeople. We worked closely with clients and supported people \nwith equipment, information and WFh guidelines to successfully \nimplement this model.\n\nc)  Health and Safety when travelling and in high risk \ncountries\n\nThe Group normally operates in countries with adequate personal \nsafety safeguards. Nevertheless, for some clients, employees may \nhave to travel in geopolitically unstable countries, or to dangerous \ngeographical areas, where there may be physical risks.\n\nRegardless of the country, there may be serious or severe external \nevents (natural disaster, terrorist attack, popular uprising, civil war, \nact of banditry,\xa0etc.), transportation accidents, or virus-related \nhealth crises. These have the potential to endanger the safety of \npeople on a Capgemini site, at a client’s premises, or while travelling.\n\nThese major and unforeseeable crises represent a threat to \nemployees and can have a significant impact on our company. To \nprevent risks and minimize their impact, we have implemented \nthe following policies:\n\n—  specific approval procedure for travel in “medium/high” risk \ncountries with strict rules (Snapshot process); \n\n—  employees must carry a mobile phone that can make \ninternational calls and give the number to the Group’s \nsecurity unit; \n\n— a ll reservations are tracked so we know when and where \nemployees are travelling, using a tool that allows us to \ncontact them 24/7, by email, SMS, or phone; \n\n—  a mobile app has been created so that employees can \ngeolocate themselves and send an emergency message if \nneeded; \n\n— g eolocation is mandatory four times a day for employees \nwho travel in specific countries; \n\n—  safety training for all travelers; \n\n—  BTA (Business Travel Accident) policy covering all emergencies \nworldwide; and\n\n—  24/7\xa0call center for emergencies.\n\nDuring the Covid-19 crisis, neither Capgemini nor Altran had any \nemployees stranded in high-risk countries, nor in a medium risk \ncountry. Altran had 22\xa0employees (family included) stranded in \nMorocco, which is a low-risk country. here, the main challenge was \nto repatriate them before air links were suspended or potential \nimmigration issues arose due to expired residence or work permits. \nAltran closely monitored each situation to reassure and accompany \nemployees, including:\n\n—  liaising with embassies and foreign affairs administrations to \nobtain reliable information; \n\n—  liaising with our external safety partners; \n—  keeping in touch with employees; \n—  allocating a repatriation plane; \n—  liaising with local governmental authorities to provide \n\nreliable information; and\n—  issuing certificates to employees so they could be safe in the \n\nevent of police checks.\n\nFor more information about these risk factors and their management, \nrefer to Section\xa03.2.1.\n\nd)  People safety and international assignments during \nCovid‑19 crisis\n\nAt the onset of the pandemic, the International Assignment Services \nteam rapidly mobilized a cross-functional task force during the \ncourse of a weekend. The task force was dedicated to supporting \nall our mobile employees and covered over 8,000\xa0employees in \nmore than 30\xa0countries. We established a centralized employee \nhelpdesk in addition to local country support networks, which was \nespecially important for providing close support and reassurance \nto our overseas Indian population with concerns and enquiries, \nmany of whom had family back in India. Over 8,500\xa0 individual \nqueries have been fielded on questions regarding insurance, \ngeneral wellbeing, repatriation available travel options, visa and \nwork permit extensions, accommodation options, and company \nquarantine support on arrival in the destination country. The team \nimmediately and proactively validated every employee’s health \ninsurance status and extended such coverage as and when required \nas the pandemic ensued.\n\nThe team also connected regularly with any stranded employees \nand ensured employee wellbeing programs were extended to all \nemployees as needed. In addition, Capgemini organized internal \nemployee town halls, as well as partner healthcare provider \nwebinars where employees were encouraged to ask qualified \ndoctors questions in active Q&A sessions. Regular (often real time) \nalerts were communicated to employees about repatriation flights \nas and when they became available.\n\nOn arrival back in India, many employees and their families were \nquarantined for up to 14\xa0days. We provided cross functional team \nsupport to ensure the employees and their families had regular \ncontact with the Company, that the financial costs were covered, \nand that employees were accompanied home at the end of the \nquarantine period. We have repatriated around 2,300\xa0employees \nand their families.\n\nIn recognition of this, our International Assignment cross functional \nteam’s Covid-19 Employee-Care Assistance Program (E-CAP) won \nthe Global hR Award for Best Adversity Management practice.\n\nAdditional people safety activities during the Covid-19 crisis included:\n\n—  procuring and providing protective and hygienic equipment \nfor our staff, such as masks and hand gel, including critical \nsourcing, logistics, and customs clearance; \n\n—  supplying masks from France to APAC, allowing APAC \nemployees to go back to work as early as February\xa02020; \n\n—  purchasing masks globally for the rest of our Group \ngeographies in time for the end of the first lockdown in \nEurope and the rest of the world; \n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nCorporate, social, and environmental policies and results\n\nCAPGEMINI 161\n\n4.\n\n—  providing a list of Covid-19 testing clinics in 15\xa0 coun\nallowing employees to travel or fly back home and/o\nbusiness travel, and to go back to their ofice after trave\n\n—  advising stranded employees: monitoring immigration is\n(expired visa while unable to leave a country,\xa0etc.) follo\nquarantine, as well as monitoring available flights to r\nto India or coming back to assignments; \n\n—  monitoring insurance for geographies and the level of \ncoverage for Covid-19 treatment, especially for travelers and \nIndian assignees under India cover; \n\ntries, \nr for \nlling; \n\nsues \nwing \n\neturn \n\n— p roviding information to reassure employees and \nmanagement, as well as psychological support, e.g. by \nsetting up support lines in partnership with Anticip and ISOS; \n\n—  organizing webinars with ISOS for management and \nemployees to reduce worry and stem any panic in employees \nwho might want to leave their jobs and return home from \ntheir host country; and\n\n— pr oducing documentation for managers and hR, and \nguidelines to communicate with employees and clients.\n\nResults and Key Performance Indicators (KPI)\n\n \n2021 \n\nTargetKPI Scope 2018 2019 2020 \n\nHealth  \n& safety\n\nCompliance with the Snapshot process  \n(% of travelers who complied with the Snapshot process) C 93% 98% 88% (1) 95%\n\nCompliance with safety/security training  \n(% of travelers who have followed the training)  \n– low risk countries C 19% 19% 19% 20%\n\nCompliance with safety/security training  \n(% of travelers who have followed the training)  \n– medium/high risk countries\n\nC 96% 96% 98% 99%\n\nScope: (C) stands for Capgemini legacy, (A) stands for Altran legacy and (C+A) for Capgemini and Altran.\n(1) 30% of non-compliant travelers were employees from Singapore on a project in Philippines with tight schedule and little notice for travel.\n\ne)  Wellbeing\n\nWhile wellbeing is always an important topic, it became even more \nrelevant during 2020. Being faced with the challenge of many \ncolleagues working from home, new routines had to be developed. \nTo successfully promote wellbeing, several stakeholders aligned \ntheir efforts, including Learning & Development to promote \ntraining and e-learnings that address topics such as work-life \nbalance, and Corporate Real Estate Services to support colleagues \nwith equipment, such as monitors to make working at home easier. \nWe also engaged with partners, such as insurers and healthcare \nproviders, who run initiatives to enhance wellbeing and support \nin the event of grief, loss or stress.\n\nThese complemented the many initiatives designed to reduce \nstress at work and focus on mental health that we had previously \nestablished, such as Employee Assistance Programs, Mental health \nChampions, and wellbeing apps such as Thrive or Sanvello. More \ndetails on the activities in India and France are described below. \nAll initiatives are reviewed regularly, and those identified as best \npractice are deployed in other countries.\n\nf)  Fighting isolation and ensuring the right to disconnect\n\nThe health crisis led Altran and Capgemini to pay particular \nattention to supporting employees feeling a sense of isolation. \nFor example, Altran France adapted existing devices to limit \nisolation and took several additional steps, such as communicating \nmore on the helpline, allowing employees to return onsite if they \nhad dificulty coping with remote working, providing advice on \nremote management and work, and coaching juniors and new \nhires. Capgemini organized mental health support programs and \npromoted the use of a 24/7\xa0helpline for mental wellbeing issues.\n\nWith the increase in remote working, as well as in normal conditions, \nwe are committed to ensuring the right to disconnect and promote \nthe importance of maintaining a good work-life balance to our \nemployees. For example, Altran France communicated several times \non the Right to Disconnect Agreement, which gives employees \nthe right to ‘switch off’ from work emails, texts,\xa0etc. at the end \n\nof the working day. In March\xa02020, Capgemini published Group \nGuidelines for Working from home focusing on preparedness, \nconnectivity, security and interactions. To address the challenges \nof remaining socially connected while being physically distanced, \nCapgemini UK developed and published “Top 10\xa0tips for working \nfrom home”, covering topics such as creating a routine and a good \nworkspace, taking regular breaks and keeping fit, as well as making \ntime to chat with colleagues. These tips have been adapted and \ncommunicated globally, by mail, via the intranet and other channels. \nBesides the global initiatives and communications, countries have \ncontinued and extended their own existing programs focusing on \nmental wellbeing, such as Time2Recharge in the Netherlands or \nTime4You in the UK.\n\ng)  Transforming the workspace\n\nWorkspace transformation – moving into the ‘new normal’ \nway of working\n\nOur working conditions were truly challenged in 2020. Our knowledge \nhas improved, and expectations have grown. The outcome is clear: \nthe focus on how and where we work has increased the need for \ncollaboration space, digital tools and pre-planned activities before \nentering an ofice space. how we see and use our sites is heading \ntowards a harmonized, hybrid way of working, embracing both on \nsite and at home models, with a rapid development of the ability \nto support collaboration both virtually and physically.\n\nTo reassure our people and make them feel welcome in our spaces, \nwe have increased our focus on safety by adding one-way circulation \npaths and hygiene stations and increasing space between seats. We \nare deploying digital SmartOfice solutions to optimize our building \nmanagement, while offering multiple services to our employees, \nallowing them to pre-plan their activity and seamlessly access the \nofice by anticipating their workspace need and preparing for how \nthey intend to use spaces on site, such as sensors for occupancy \nand the ability to book seats remotely. Virtual collaboration tools \nand solutions are of high importance and both the technology to \naccess our sites and pre-plan visits are under development and \ndeployment.\n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nCorporate, social, and environmental policies and results\n\n162 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n4.\n\nFlexibility on site makes it possible to change space based on \nactivities and evolving needs. Rooms can be rearranged by merging \nor splitting space to host the right number of people. Open areas \nare not as large as before, and the space is divided into smaller \nopen Sections to decrease noise levels and host smaller groups \nof people, while still being in close proximity and with access to \ndifferent space areas.\n\nWe have launched 224\xa0workplace transformation projects since 2016, \nwith 216\xa0already completed, which represent 49% of our portfolio \nnow that Altran is part of the Capgemini group. While continuing \nthe transformation of our real estate, we are now taking digital \ninnovation to a higher level and accelerating our environmental \nprograms to meet even more powerful goals, such as being Carbon \nNeutral by 2025 and becoming a Net Zero company by 2030.\n\nHealth, Security and Wellbeing: Focus on India\n\nCreating a safe and healthy work environment is critical to the \nsuccess of our business in India and is one of the best ways to \nretain staff and maximize productivity. The Oh&S (Occupational \nhealth & Safety) program at Capgemini India encompasses a wide \nnetwork of stakeholders: employees, suppliers and clients. The \norganization was recently certified to the Occupational health & \nSafety Standard ISO\xa045001:2018 covering all its 30\xa0operational sites.\n\na)  Health and Security\n\nCapgemini India’s h&S policy has been defined along with the \nGovernance Board, to which the India Corporate Real Estate Service \n(ICRES) health Safety and Environment (hSE) team reports on a \nquarterly basis. It includes a standardized medical service for all \nlocations (doctor, paramedic and full-time ambulance on site). \nErgonomic awareness sessions are available for all employees and \nEmergency Response Team (ERT) members are identified for every \nlocation, with their contacts made available to all employees – the \nERT team is trained twice a year on advanced first aid services by \nexperts in the industry and on floor emergency protocols. A hazard \nidentification and risk assessment exercise is carried out on an \nongoing basis, empowering us to identify new risks proactively, \nand take the necessary corrective actions. Appropriate control \nmeasures are adopted/modified, with defined and frequent \nmonitoring, when a specific hazard is identified.\n\nIndia’s h&S policy intends to:\n\n—  assign adequate resources to ensure continual improvement \nin Occupational health & Safety performance; \n\n—  identify and comply with the relevant legal and other \nrequirements applicable to Occupational health & Safety; \n\n—  identify hazards and assess the risks, enabling suitable \ncontrols to be implemented to avoid the risk or to ensure it is \nas low as reasonably practicable; \n\n—  identify appropriate Occupational health & Safety objectives \nand targets for periodic performance reviews; \n\n—  communicate and inform all employees, interested parties \nand all relevant stakeholders (customers, visitors and \ncontractors, support staff, vendors/suppliers) of their \nobligation to take responsible care for the safety and health \nof themselves and others; \n\n—  provide guidance, training and awareness to employees and \nall relevant stakeholders wherever needed (support staff, \ncustomers, vendors) to ensure a safe workplace;\n\n— d evelop measures and processes to focus on prevention of \nworkplace incidents; \n\n— de velop and maintain protocols on pandemic/crisis \nmanagement in India in collaboration with India BCM, India \nhR and wellness partners; \n\n—  engage with employees and relevant stakeholders on \nissues/process improvement recommendations regarding \noccupational health & Safety through an effective feedback \nsystem; \n\n—  ensure all the OhS issues associated with our key activities are \nconsidered during the procurement process and necessary \nstakeholders are consulted in the process. Where possible, \nwe will favor the use of suppliers who can demonstrate \nsound business practices towards health and Safety; \n\n—  key relevant stakeholders are consulted while conceptualizing \nwellness programs; \n\n—  communicate the policy to all people working under the \ncontrol of the organization and ensure it is made available to \nthe interested parties upon request; and\n\n— e nsure the policy is reviewed periodically and that it applies \nto all ofices managed by Capgemini within India.\n\nb)  Wellbeing\n\nIndia’s overarching framework of Oh&S covers all the functional areas \nof employee wellbeing services, from transport, food & beverage, \nonsite clinics, physical security, support staff, and customer and \nvisitor safety. In the backdrop of the evolving Covid-19 crisis and \nthe emphasis on working from home, extensive support is being \nextended to employees and their family members.\n\nCovid‑19 Care & Support\n\n— c omplimentary doctor’s teleconsultations for employees \nand their family members; \n\n—  testing and hospitalization support across India, on a best \neffort basis; and\n\n—  complimentary 10-day Covid-19 Remote homecare Recovery \nProgram for employees and their dependents through our \ncorporate partnership with Portea homecare.\n\nHolistic wellness\n\n—  daily guided meditation sessions, yoga sessions, wellness \nconsulting, focus on diet and nutrition; \n\n—  focused interventions on ergonomics involving training, \nlive workouts and video nuggets, and an Infrastructure \nAssistance Program to provide needy employees with the \noption of taking home their ergonomic-friendly ofice chair; \nand\n\n— ha ppiness & Wellbeing: Curated health talks, meditation \nsessions, fire side chats, teleconsultation, medical advisory \nand bulletins/communications that bring together all aspects \nof physical, emotional and spiritual wellbeing.\n\nIn addition to physical wellbeing, there is an established Employee \nAssistance Program that provides counseling on an array of topics \nranging from stress management to work-life balance.\n\nMental wellness\n\n—  webinars on various topics to de-stigmatize mental health \nand spot psychoanalysis of employee stress levels, and \nunlimited phone counselling;\n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nCorporate, social, and environmental policies and results\n\nCAPGEMINI 163\n\n4.\n\n—  enhanced virtual employee engagement with expert \ntalks that weave in parenting, family support, elder care, \nmindfulness, resilience, sleep.

We ensure compliance with relevant standards and \nagreements and work to optimize their implementation from \nyear to year. This has been ongoing since 2017 with 25\xa0health & \nSafety Committees, and again since 2020 with the evolution of \nFrench law (evolution of the ordonnance n°\xa02017-1386 of 2017), \nthe establishment of an internal Social and Economic Council and \nCapgemini’s own body of local representatives. The aim is to:\n\n—  support employees with work-related stress or problems and \nfind a solution together. Every employee can raise and alert \nand get help to resolve their problem; \n\n—  gather regular collective diagnoses, based on alerts raised, \nso as to carry out targeted and effective preventive actions, \nthus anticipating and dealing with the causes of stress and \nproblems at work.\n\nIn June\xa02017, a health at Work agreement was signed with the social \npartners and deployed collectively through dedicated Steering \nCommittees. Given the new corporate structure, an amendment \nto this agreement was signed in December\xa02019.\n\nSome of these initiatives are detailed below:\n\n—  a medical consultation service is available 24/7, on all the \nsites; \n\n— a  helpline provides a listening and support mechanism for \nany employee suffering because of their working conditions. \nThis is also a health prevention initiative; \n\n—  employees can work remotely up to 3\xa0 days per week. This \nsystem is part of a preventive health care approach and \ncontributes to a better work-life balance; \n\n—  right to disconnect: all employees are informed of their \nright to disconnect and receive e-learning training on how to \neffectively manage digital communication tools; and\n\n—  to obtain an overall view, in 2018 Capgemini France carried \nout a survey on the quality of work life, which led in 2019 \nto deploying specific cross-disciplinary Economic and Social \nUnit (ESU) and local action plans with each health, Safety and \nWorking Conditions Committee (hSWCC).\n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nCorporate, social, and environmental policies and results\n\n164 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n4.\n\nThe cross-disciplinary ESU action plan focuses on 3\xa0areas:\n\n1.  Psychosocial Risk (PSR) training which trains managers in \nPSR and helps them to better support employees with work \nrelated stress factors (lack of time to do everything, too \nmuch complex information, recurrent interruptions in their \ntasks\xa0etc.); Since 2021, this training is now available in remote \nformat. \n\n2.  Time management between jobs, aimed at improving the \nmanagement of inter-contract periods and reducing the \nimpact in terms of stress.\n\n3.  Quality of Work Life (QWL) and stress management, aimed at \nreducing the impact of stress factors by offering innovative \n\nQWL initiatives to our employees (pilot schemes on various \nQWL and health at work topics such as health, ergonomics, \nstress management).\n\nDuring 2020, a set of QWL actions were deployed in collaboration \nwith the monitoring committee of health at work agreement within \nthe UES Capgemini in France: awareness actions like well-being \nguide, communication of “Minute Santé”, access to the YOGIST \nPlatform (YOGA on workstation), training on teleworking gestures \nand postures (e-learning),\xa0etc.\n\nFor Altran France, awareness-raising and communication initiatives \non health and Safety at work are regularly carried out to prevent \nvarious risks.\n\nResults and Key Performance Indicators (KPI)\n\n KPI Scope 2019 2020 2021 Target\n\nHelpline Effectiveness of the helpline (number of files) C 23 40 Maintain the system \nand the quality \nof support for \n\nemployees\n\nRemote  \nworking\n\nRemote working rate by employees  \n(number of employees and % of the Capgemini  \nFrance workforce)\n\nC 3,985 \n(15.7%)\n\n4,620 \n(18.63%) \n\nImplementation of \nthe “new normal” \n\nshould significantly \nincrease the number \n\nof remote workers \nand at this stage a \n\nquantitative target \ncannot be fixed\n\nHealth program Employees with health and welfare coverage C 100% 100%  \n\nScope: (C) stands for Capgemini legacy, (A) stands for Altran legacy and (C+A) for Capgemini and Altran.\n\nExplanations of the results\n\nHelpline: The number of times the helpline was used between \n2017 (66), 2018 (38), 2019 (23) and 2020 (40) is not significant for \nthe following reasons: 1. the hSWCC handled specific individual \nsituations; 2. New initiatives have been launched such as SpeakUP \n(confidential phone and internet helpline managed by an independent \ncontractor available for employees, suppliers, clients and partners); \n3. at the same time surveys have been conducted within the Group: \nstimulus and/or deployment of “Pulse” which employees can use \nto express concerns.\n\nhowever, it is important to add that the helpline comes in addition \nto existing mechanisms, without replacing them: management, \nhuman resources managers members of the hSWCC or staff \ndelegates until 31\xa0December\xa02019 (since January\xa02020, these \nbodies no longer exist and are replaced within Capgemini ESCU \nby the local representatives), health at work department, health \nand Safety contacts.\n\nSince the helpline was set up, work related calls are mainly about:\n\n—  work (organization, load, complexity): 32.5%\n—  relationship problems: 20%\n—  recognition: 7.5%\n—  isolation: 7.5%\n—  open files for personal reasons (health, family breakdown, \n\ndeath) represent 10%.\n\nQuality of Life Survey\n\nThe quality of life survey was carried out in 2018, with a participation \nrate of 29.4% (or 6,961\xa0employees). The figure in the “high stress \nlevel” category was 20.7%, which is lower than data from national \n(25%) and European (28%) surveys. The figures for low stress levels \nand high stress levels are 54% and 25.3% respectively and do not \nraise specific alarm bells.\n\nIn 2020, a survey on remote working (35% of responding employees) \nwas carried out among the 25,000\xa0Capgemini employees in France. \nThis survey, built with staff representatives, was focused on the \nway in which remote working was experienced by employees, in \nparticular, possible psychosocial risks and their wishes to continue \nteleworking after the crisis.\n\n4.1.1.7  People Experience \n\nCapgemini is convinced that the experience it offers to its employees \nis the key lever for driving the Group’s attraction and retention, \nand ultimately employee engagement. To foster an inclusive, \nmeaningful and open environment, the Group has defined a global \nexperience approach and encourages employees to share their point \nof view to contribute to improving it constantly and to adapt it to \nthe fast-paced changes in employee expectations. These efforts \ndirectly support the Group’s Inclusion and Talent strategies.\n\nPolicies and Actions\n\na)  People Experience Framework\n\nCapgemini is aligning across the Group on Employee Experience \nthrough a global and common framework. In 2020, this framework \nevolved from an “Employee Experience” scope (mainly internal and \nemployee-focused) to a ‘People Experience’ scope, including external \nelements relevant to the experience of candidates. It is based on \n10\xa0areas (Brand Awareness, Effective & Engaging Onboarding, \nPerformance & Success\xa0etc.) that are holistic cross-functional levers \nimpacting the experience and enabling the Group to:\n\n—  align flexibly ambitions and objectives; \n—  link to key transformation programs; and\n—  measure the impact of these programs on employee \n\nengagement.\n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nCorporate, social, and environmental policies and results\n\nCAPGEMINI 165\n\n4.\n\nThe main measurement elements are Glassdoor (mainly for the \nexternal component) and Pulse for the internal component. A formal \nmapping of the 6\xa0Glassdoor drivers (Culture & values; Work Life \nBalance; Senior Management; Compensation & Benefits; Growth \n– Career Path; Diversity & Inclusion) to the equivalent Pulse drivers \nhelps create a stronger alignment of actions and provides support \nfor a more authentic Employer Value Proposal.\n\nb)  Pulse: Continuous employee listening\n\n“Pulse” is Capgemini’s continuous employee listening platform that \ncaptures the voice of all employees through monthly engagement \nsurveys that are voluntary and anonymous. It is based on a global \nengagement model with two sets of questions around engagement \nand loyalty and 14\xa0specific drivers (e.g. autonomy, rewards…). The \nfully digital and automated setup allows us to capture the feedback \non these drivers and is accessible in real time to the leadership team, \nreducing time between feedback and action. Pulse thereby enables \nthe empowerment of all levels of the organization, by providing \nrelevant insights to identify priorities and adapt our management \nand human resources strategies, policies and practices.\n\nFully deployed since 2019, the overall Employee Engagement score, \nmeasured on a 0\xa0to 10\xa0scale and the eNPS (employee Net Promoter \nScore) measured on a -100\xa0to a +100\xa0scale, are key indicators tracked \nby leadership across the Group.\n\nDuring 2020:\n\n—  the overall Engagement score improved significantly from \n7.2\xa0at the end of 2019 to 7.7\xa0at the end of 2020;\n\n—  the eNPS scores increased from 6\xa0to 26 in the same timeframe \nshowing strong increase in the ratio of employees that are \npromoters of Capgemini as a great place to work;\n\n—  the annual employee participation rate reached 70%.\n\nThe Pulse employee engagement metrics are now monitored at \nall levels of the Group (from Board to operations) and enable a \ngranular view through many attributes (business unit, country, \ngender, age group, management level, tenure, and others) to further \nunderstand and act on employee perceptions and expectations \nin a focused way.\n\nStatistics as of December 31st, 2020 for (Capgemini legacy scope)\n\nMen Women\n\nEngagement score\n(by gender, on a 10 level scale)\n\neNPS\n(by gender, from -100 to +100)\n\nActively engaged employees\n(by gender, in %)\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\nEngagement score\n(by management level, on a 10 level scale)\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\neNPS\n(by management level, from -100 to +100)\n\n50\n\n40\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\nActively engaged employees\n(by management level, in %)\n\n100%\n\n80%\n\n60%\n\n40%\n\n20%\n\n100%\n\n80%\n\n60%\n\n40%\n\n20%\n\n<2\n0\n\n20\n-2\n\n4\n\n25\n-2\n\n9\n\n30\n-3\n\n4\n\n35\n-3\n\n9\n\n40\n-4\n\n4\n\n45\n-4\n\n9\n\n50\n-5\n\n4\n≥5\n\n5\n\nEngagement score\n(by age group, on a 10 level scale)\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n<2\n0\n\n20\n-2\n\n4\n\n25\n-2\n\n9\n\n30\n-3\n\n4\n\n35\n-3\n\n9\n\n40\n-4\n\n4\n\n45\n-4\n\n9\n\n50\n-5\n\n4\n≥5\n\n5\n\neNPS\n(by age group, from -100 to +100)\n\n75\n\n60\n\n45\n\n30\n\n15\n\n<2\n0\n\n20\n-2\n\n4\n\n25\n-2\n\n9\n\n30\n-3\n\n4\n\n35\n-3\n\n9\n\n40\n-4\n\n4\n\n45\n-4\n\n9\n\n50\n-5\n\n4\n≥5\n\n5\n\nActively engaged employees\n(by age group, in %)\n\nMen Women\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\nMen Women\n\n100%\n\n80%\n\n60%\n\n40%\n\n20%\n\n7.8 7.7\n\nA\n\n8\n\nB\n\n7.7\n\nC\n\n7.6\n\nD\n\n7.7\n\nE\n\n7.9\n\nF\n\n8.4\n\nA\n\n35\n\nB\n\n25\n\nC\n\n19\n\nD\n\n23\n\nE\n\n32\n\nF\n\n50\n\nA\n\n84\n\nB\n\n81\n\nC\n\n79\n\nD\n\n81\n\nE\n\n86\n\nF\n\n91\n\n8.5 8.2\n7.7 7.7 7.6 7.7 7.6 7.5 7.5 57\n\n42\n\n26\n23 21 22 21\n\n18 17\n\n91\n87\n\n81 80 79 80 80 79 79\n\n26\n24\n\n82 81\n\nKey: eNPS stands for employee Net Promoter Score.\n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nCorporate, social, and environmental policies and results\n\n166 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n4.\n\nThis model was critical in keeping pulse on employees’ engagement \nand enabled managers and leaders across the Group to monitor \nand react to the qualitative and quantitative feedback from their \nteams when the Covid-19 crisis forced remote working.\n\nSpecific questions were added around the quality of interactions \nbetween colleagues and frequency of interactions with the team, \nmanager and client during Covid-19 to further understand and \ndrive engagement.\n\nIn general, Pulse listening helped our business and hR teams to \ndrive impactful initiatives. here are some examples:\n\n—  India rolled out a new flexi-work & sabbatical policy, CLAP \nprogram to drive recognition, new young emerging leaders’ \nprogram to uplift young leadership talent and many more; \n\n—  North America started “Let’s talk” initiative to let our \nleadership host conversation with specific target employee \ngroups to address their concerns and build trust; and\n\n—  Insights & Data (I&D) Global Business Line revised maternity \nleave policy in the UK to support working mothers. I&D \nin North America put together an employee experience \nprogram specifically for young graduates and campus hires \nfor their career progression.\n\nPulse is also a change driver through Pulse extensions. Two fully \ndedicated rounds in 2020 focused on two key priority areas:\n\n—  Ethical culture: elevating and integrating the traditional \nEthics survey into the global Pulse infrastructure,\n\n—  Capgemini’s Purpose: involving all Capgemini employees in \ngiving their views on Capgemini’s Purpose definition.\n\nPulse also supported the integration of colleagues following \nAltran’s acquisition by running a ‘post-merger integration’ Pulse \nsurvey with all 50,000\xa0Altran colleagues in October\xa02020. The \nsurvey helped identify common strengths and prioritize action \nareas. In 2021, Pulse will cover all new colleagues from Altran \non a monthly basis, aligning with the Capgemini cycle. The Pulse \nplatform will continue expanding its scope and plays a key part in \nfurther integrating the Group’s survey management.\n\nc)  Glassdoor – Bringing an external view to employee \nexperience\n\nWe have increasingly focused on Glassdoor as a medium to listen, \nanalyze and deeply understand our employees’ experiences. In \n\n2019 and 2020, we have actively encouraged employees across \n25\xa0countries to leave a review on Glassdoor. A team of 40\xa0global \ncolleagues worked on a singular mission to attract and engage \ntalent via Glassdoor Capgemini profile. They also monitored \nreviews to capture perceptions on our employee experiences: work \nenvironment, culture and values, tools and technology, leadership \nand management, compensation and recognition, diversity and \ninclusion and interactions with people. These reviews have been \nregularly analyzed locally and globally to identify our employees’ \nspecific expectations. We leverage Glassdoor to craft experiences \nthat are not only motivating and pleasing for our employees, but \nthat also meet their needs and concrete expectations. Recently, \nwe have taken our people experience a notch higher by integrating \nGlassdoor and Pulse. This provides a richer perspective of an \nemployee’s experience from pre-onboarding to post-exit.\n\nd)  People Analytics \n\nIn 2020, the Group accelerated the building of a data-driven \nculture in hR by formally launching the People Analytics function. \nThe function is designed to apply analytical techniques on data \nto improve business outcomes through better decision-making \nconcerning people and business objectives. Some of the key \nprojects delivered include:\n\n— t he designing of the new normal policies by understanding \nkey topics for employees at the start of the Covid-19 crisis \nthrough Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques; \n\n— t he roll-out of new promotion policy to eliminate gender bias \nin the promotion process; \n\n—  the measurement of the impact of learning programs on \noverall engagement scores,\xa0etc.; and\n\n— t he prediction of the retention risk of high performer cohorts \nto take proactive measures and reduce the cost to business.\n\nPeople Analytics also introduces metrics on employees that are \nlinked to business performance/outcomes. One key action area \nwas the creation of champions with analytical capabilities within \nhR to accelerate the data-driven approach and launch dedicated \npeople analytics training courses (‘Foundations’, ‘Practitioners’).\n\nThese supplement the already existing People Analytics capacities \nin the stafing and workforce planning area. Being part of the \nDelivery operations, it tightly supports the effective matching of \navailable profiles to open client opportunities through an advanced \nstafing toolset and AI.\n\n KPI Scope 2018 2019 2020 \n\nGroup engagement score Aggregate average Engagement Score  \n(from 0\xa0to 10) (1)  \n\nC N/A 7.2 7.7 \n\nGroup eNPS (employee  \nNet Promoter Score)\n\n% number of promoters (score: 9-10)  \nless % number of detractors (0-6) (1)  \n\nC N/A 6 26 \n\nPulse participation  \nrate\n\nAggregate full year employee participation rate in Pulse  \n(in %) (1)  \n\nC N/A 64 70 \n\nActively engaged \nemployees (2)  \n\nPart of the workforce with Engagement Score 7-10  \n(in %) ( 1)  \n\nC N/A 73 81 \n\nScope: (C) stands for Capgemini legacy, (A) stands for Altran legacy and (C+A) for Capgemini and Altran.\n(1) Note: These numbers are covering Capgemini legacy only, excluding Altran scope. They therefore cover 81.5% of the total Group’s FTEs.\n(2) Definition: SASB Actively engaged: The classification should generally reflect the use of 4, 5, 7 or 10\xa0point scales, where “actively engaged” is 3-4\xa0on a 4\xa0point scale, 4-5\xa0on \n\na 5\xa0point scale, 5-7\xa0on a 7\xa0point scale, and 7-10\xa0on a 10\xa0point scale, or the equivalent. Sources: The Vitality Institute and Aon hewitt. Determining who is actively engaged: \nEngagement is generally determined through a composite score derived from several questions. however, it may also be determined with a single question about “overall” \nengagement. Whatever the case, the result should be provided in a scale that corresponds to the above definitions of “actively engaged”.\n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nCorporate, social, and environmental policies and results\n\nCAPGEMINI 167\n\n4.\n\n4.1.1.8  Reward and compensation\n\nThe Group’s compensation philosophy is based on shared principles, \napplied in a decentralized way and tailored to local job market \nconditions and regulations under a global governance structure. \nThis philosophy provides a foundation for us to make consistent \nhiring and promotion decisions, which are linked to our business \nstrategy, corporate goals and objectives, and aims to reward the \nappropriate behaviors that drive sustainable results. Capgemini \ngroup is committed to providing competitive total reward \nopportunities that attract, retain and motivate our employees. \nhence, our philosophy aims to:\n\n—  attract and retain talent; \n\n—  reward individual and collective performance with a \nremuneration model that is motivating yet flexible, \nincentivizing high performance in an ethical environment; \n\n—  be fair and aligned with the Group’s strategic targets.\n\nThese principles are regularly reviewed to ensure consistency \nwith market trends and evolutions and are deployed and managed \nlocally to ensure compliance with local regulations. Regarding the \nVice-President population, compensation schemes are designed, \nreviewed and approved at Group level for both fixed and variable \ncomponents on a yearly basis following best market practices. \nFor other employees eligible to variable compensation schemes, \nthe design and principles are built within a global framework in \norder to promote mobility and ensure consistency and fairness.\n\nThe total reward package for a given employee includes a fixed \nsalary, a variable part for eligible employees based on individual and \ncompany performance and a set of benefits which are not all cash \nrelated and are aligned to competitive market practices in terms \nof healthcare, retirement or employee wellness, among others.\n\nThe Group also offers its employees the ability to participate and \ninvest in an employee share ownership plan (ESOP). This plan was \nfirst launched in 2009 and has been launched on an annual basis \nsince 2017. In 2020, 96% of the Group’s employees, including Altran, \nparticipated in the last ESOP plan. The Group also grants annually \nperformance shares to a more senior population and some key \ncontributors in the organization under the approval of the Board \nof Directors (more than 2,400\xa0people covered in 2020, including \nAltran employees). See below for further details.\n\nWhere local rules permit, employees can select the components of \ntheir remuneration package from a predefined package (Flexible \nCompensation Schemes). This provides employees with additional \nflexibility, enabling them to reconcile their financial and personal \nsituations in the best possible way. Profit-sharing is available to \nemployees pursuant to the local regulations applicable in the \ncountry. The minimum salaries applied by the Group in each \ncountry always exceed or are equal to the legal minimum wage \nin force in the country concerned and are sometimes higher by a \nvery significant proportion.\n\nPay equity is a strong internal focus: we ensure that we are \ncompliant with prevailing legislation and monitor this topic, \nthrough leveraging external certification with EDGE. In France \nwe have an annual review of pay equity following a methodology \npresented and validated with employee representatives which \ndisclosed very limited variances for similar roles. This has enabled \nus to reach a score of 39\xa0out of a maximum of 40\xa0on this item in the \n2019 gender equality index launched by the French government \n(and published for the first time in 2018). This high score is driven \nby a less than 2% variance between men and women (in favour of \nmen) overall within France and reflects the long-term work with \nemployee representatives on this matter. In addition, we had the \nmaximum scores for the percentage of promotions as compared \nbetween men and women and in relation to the fair treatment of \nwomen returning from maternity leave.\n\nSalary increase guidelines are also reviewed and approved at Group \nlevel in close alignment with most up to date market trends. The \nGroup has implemented a strong cross function governance (hR, \nFinance and Procurement), supported by an international partner \nto monitor, optimize, evolve and improve employee benefits \ncoverage for our employees.\n\nThe evolution of compensation (which can be found in the Note\xa07\xa0to \nthe consolidated financial statements) is subject to regular analysis \nas compensation costs represent 65% of the Group revenue. Regular \nmonitoring is made of the average compensation cost evolution \nacross operations to evaluate, monitor and anticipate the impact \nof staff demographics dynamic (recruits, leavers, promotions,\xa0etc.) \non the evolution of this key indicator.\n\nThe Compensation Committee of the Capgemini\xa0SE Board of \nDirectors makes recommendations to the Board of Directors on \nthe compensation of the Company’s Executive Corporate Oficers \nand is informed of the compensation policies related to the Group \nsenior managers, in particular equity-based incentives which are \nsubject to Board approval.\n\nAllocation of share-based incentive schemes\n\nCapgemini\xa0SE has allocated share-based instruments (previously \nstock options and performance shares since 2009) on a regular \nbasis in line with its Corporate Governance rules. These allocations \nare made selectively with the aim of rewarding employee loyalty, \nnamely for those who have made exceptional contributions to \ncompany sales, production, innovation or to reward those who \nhave been acknowledged for specific initiatives or who are seen \nas transformation agents. Any employee in the Group may be \nselected to receive them. This is an exceptional reward, not \nguaranteed on a year basis and does not form part of the general \nremuneration policy.\n\nThe Management Report, presented at each Capgemini\xa0 SE \nshareholders meeting, provides a detailed yearly breakdown of \nthe performance share allocations (see Section\xa02.3.4 for further \ninformation).\n\nCurrently, performance shares granted to Executive Corporate \nOfficers represent a very low percentage of the total shares \ndistributed. The associated resolution sets a maximum limit of 10% \nto be allocated to Executive Corporate Oficers and the volume \neffectively allocated to them represents a much lower volume, \nwith less than 3% of the total grants of all performance share \nplans since 2009. Also, the number of people benefiting from \nsuch allocation is growing in order to associate more and more \nemployees to the Group long term performance. The 2020 grant \nincluded beneficiaries from Altran.\n\nDetailed information regarding performance shares allocated \nby Capgemini\xa0SE to Executive Corporate Oficers and to the ten \nmain beneficiaries (non-directors), the options exercised by the \nlatter, and details of these plans are provided in Section\xa06.1.4\xa0of \nthis Universal Registration Document.\n\nEmployee stock access\n\nIn 2009, Capgemini launched its first international employee stock \nownership plan, covering 19\xa0countries. Building on the initial success, \nnew plans were launched in 2012 and in 2014. Since 2017, Employee \nShare Ownership Plans are run on a yearly basis. All plans have been \noversubscribed and the most recent ones massively, well above \n160%. The coverage of the offer is progressively extended, and last \nplan was covering 26\xa0countries and included from the beginning a \nsignificant proportion of Altran employees. As a result, more than \n40,000\xa0employees have participated in the latest plan and the \nemployee share ownership has further increased in 2020 to reach \n6.9% of our share capital. This has enabled us since 2012 to have \nemployee shareholder representation on the Board of Directors \nof Capgemini\xa0SE (please refer to Section\xa02.1.3).\n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nCorporate, social, and environmental policies and results\n\n168 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n4.\n\n4.1.1.9  Labor relations \n\na)  Labor relations at Group level: International Works \nCouncil (IWC)\n\nEmployee dialogue is crucial to the success of the Group and goes \nhand in hand with its business development strategy, focused on \nperformance and delivery for our customers. Employees are the \nmain factor of our success. In that respect, employee dialogue is a \npowerful tool to move forward, while allowing safe and conflict-free \nchange. We have implemented tools enabling a strong employee \ndialogue at all levels of the organization, both locally and globally.\n\nThe International Works Council (IWC) was first set up in 2001 ahead \nof European regulations, and then extended to other regions of \nthe Group. Its mission is to put forward employees’ interests to \nmanagement, and to be kept informed of action plans and projects \nmade by management regarding their impact on employees.\n\nThe IWC aspires to:\n\n—  be an advisory body to Group Management on employee \nmatters; \n\n—  exercise positive influence; \n—  foster cooperation among employees and different parts of \n\nthe Group; and\n—  contribute to making Capgemini an inspiring environment \n\nfor all.\n\nThe representative of the Group Management is the Chair of the IWC, \nwho acts in conformity with the Group’s decisions and strategies.\n\nIWC has a maximum of 60\xa0members in total. The statutory members \nof the IWC are delegated by the countries participating in the \nEuropean Agreement. Other delegated members are designated \nguest members. A guest member may represent a country or a \nminority group.\n\nThe employees are represented by country delegates and by a \npermanent standing body called IWC Bureau. The Bureau is composed \nof eight delegates: four representing the top four European \ncountries, and four elected by voting country representatives. \nOnly member countries have voting rights; invited members are \nonly allowed to support the process.\n\nThe CEO attends the IWC Meeting at least once a year, and the \nGroup Executive Board members are regularly invited to attend \nthe meetings for open discussions with IWC members.\n\nSince 2016, two Directors representing the employees have been \nappointed to the Board of Directors, going beyond statutory \nrequirements. One Board member was designated by the French \nunions and the second was elected by the IWC noting that the latter \nwas already invited by the Chairman and CEO of the Company since \n2015 to sit on the Board and in the Compensation Committee.\n\nLikewise, Altran considers that employee dialogue is an essential \npart of a progressive social policy and contributes to the Group’s \nsuccessful operations. In 2018 Altran set up a European Works \nCouncil (EWC) representing 14\xa0trade unions and 7\xa0national Works \nCouncils, with elected personnel representatives from 10\xa0countries. \nAltran’s European Works Council met 18\xa0times in 2020 (10\xa0committee \nsessions and 8\xa0plenary sessions) in 2020. The meetings are chaired \nby the Group’s human resources Director.\n\nb)  Labor relations and employee dialogue at local level\n\nCountry employee representatives and Works Councils are strategic \npartners in all organizational and operational transformations. This \nis reflected operationally in the countries, where unions, Work \nCouncils and social representatives lead a continuous dialogue \nwith Capgemini business leadership and hR. Labor agreements \nsigned in cooperation with both parties contribute to a better, \nsafer, healthier work environment for all employees.\n\nCapgemini acknowledges that collective and enterprise agreements \nare an opportunity to materialize a healthy and transparent social \ndialogue, as well as concrete advancements in labor conditions \nand work environment that benefit the Company by increasing \nwellbeing at work, employees’ satisfaction and engagement. In \n2020, many new or renewed collective agreements have been \nsigned. here are some examples of our labor agreements:\n\n—  in France, there were 10\xa0 agreements signed in 2020 \ncovering compensation and benefits (including employee \nprofit-sharing), health and Safety, ESOP employee \nshareholding program, Agreement on Employees Career \nDevelopment and Training Plan, organizational evolutions, \namong others; \n\n—  in Italy, 2\xa0collective agreements on Covid-19 risk prevention \nand security management initiatives were signed; \n\n—  in the UK, there is a Capgemini Works Council with \nrepresentatives elected by employees in Market Units, \nPractices and Global Business Lines within the UK geography. \nWhere required by law, Capgemini negotiates pay for union \nmembers and has framework agreements with three unions. \n10\xa0 specific collective bargaining agreements are in place \nfor groups of employees inherited through Transfer of \nUndertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations 2006 \n(TUPE); and\n\n—  in Germany, our companies did not negotiate collective \nbargaining agreements but agreed on 129\xa0 collective \nagreements with Works Council Committees, both local and \ncentral. Those agreements cover compensation, technical \nimplementations, health and Safety, partial unemployment \nand career model among others.\n\n4.1.2  Digital Inclusion \n\nTechnology and people have been at the heart of our Group since \nits creation over 50\xa0years ago. This strong connection has led to \na deep sense of responsibility in terms of both the impacts of \ntechnology and the risks of being excluded from its opportunities \nin an increasingly connected world. That’s why we are committed to \nbeing a leader in Digital Inclusion – because we believe technology \nshould open doors to the future for all.\n\nDigital Inclusion and equipping everyone with the skills they need \nfor a digital world is also an opportunity for our industry – we need \nskilled talent, and we all have a responsibility to make careers in \ntechnology possible for everyone.\n\nBridging the digital divide has been more important than ever in \nthe past year. As Covid-19 raged across the world, the deprivation \nof already excluded populations and those at risk reached record \nlevels. While digitalization helped a confined world continue \nfunctioning, access to basic and fundamental rights/services \nbecame digital almost overnight, leaving millions of digitally \nexcluded people helpless.\n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nCorporate, social, and environmental policies and results\n\nCAPGEMINI 169\n\n4.\n\nOur Digital Inclusion ambition and objectives found even more \nmeaning in the current context and 2020 has certainly been a year \nof massive mobilization from so many people within the Group. \nThey not only sought to bridge the existing digital divide but also \ncame to the aid of the most vulnerable and excluded. The rapid \nand sudden digitalization of public and private services in the \nface of the pandemic accelerated the digital divide as accessing \nessential public services like registering online to receive economic, \nsocial, and even sanitary help from the government to survive the \npandemic became digital. The result? Even deeper exclusion of \nthose who were already excluded, or at the risk of being excluded.\n\nThis situation acted as an accelerator for action across Capgemini. \nOur people responded with strong commitment, passion, and \nparticipation in numerous initiatives, such as our Social Response \nUnit created in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic (see \nSection\xa04.1.4 for further information). Digital empowerment \ncontinues to determine whether someone is digitally and socially \nincluded or excluded, especially given the Covid-19 crisis context. \nOur commitment and actions therefore not only address the need \nfor disadvantaged and excluded people to be educated in basic \ndigital skills, but also enable them to overcome social exclusion.\n\n2020 has been about building on the Digital Inclusion impact \nwe started creating in 2018 and becoming the much‑needed \nbridge between technology, business and society. As a leading \nresponsible company, we continue to design our actions by first \nunderstanding exclusion and how it impacts different sets of \nsociety in different parts of the world. Our strategy on Digital \nInclusion is hence customized before implementation in \ndifferent societies and contexts. This ensures that we can help \ndisadvantaged people in the most impactful manner and bring \nthem out of exclusion.\n\nWe drive impactful Digital Inclusion initiatives hand in hand with \nour ecosystem of NGOs, social innovation organizations and clients \nacross 4 main streams: Digital Literacy, Digital Academy, Tech for \nPositive Futures and Advocacy & thought leadership, all of which \nare supported/enabled by employee engagement.\n\nThanks to our streamlined efforts on Digital Inclusion, we have \nachieved over 80% alignment of all social impact initiatives. This \nhas grown from 50% alignment in 2018 and through 74% alignment \nin 2019. From 2021 onwards, we will continue to maintain this \nalignment and deliver positive impact through Digital Inclusion \nacross the Group.\n\nAdditionally, Altran’s integration within Capgemini will further \nreinforce our actions on each of our Digital Inclusion pillars, \nleveraging more NGOs, business, and social partners across wider \ncommunities globally.\n\nThe actions we design and implement across our Digital Inclusion \npillars in communities around the world are strongly aligned \nwith the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  \nWe focus particularly on SDG 4 (Quality Education), SDG 5 (Gender \nequality), SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) and SDG 10 \n(Reduced Inequalities).\n\nGoal 4: Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and \npromote lifelong learning opportunities for all: Through our \nDigital Literacy programs, we provide foundational digital skills \nto the excluded, while also tackling the challenges of providing \naccess to digital tools to the most disadvantaged. Our Digital \nAcademies are another important facet of our Digital Inclusion \nactivity. They focus on providing specialized training in on-demand \nIT and ITES training to disadvantaged populations (e.g. refugees, \nwomen, marginalized groups, elderly, school/college drop-outs, \nex-offenders, disabled, refugees, homeless,\xa0etc.). Topics include \ncybersecurity, web development and artificial intelligence. Both \nour Digital Literacy and Digital Academy initiatives are therefore \ncommitted to enabling the disadvantaged with inclusive and \nequitable education so that they can become independent and \npursue better opportunities.\n\nGoal 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls: \nWe are committed to opening up Science, technology, engineering, \nand mathematics (STEM) careers to more women. To this end, \nwe have several Digital Literacy programs that are designed to \nspread awareness and inspire girls and young women to pursue \ncareers in technology. Aside from ensuring a fair representation of \nwomen among our trainees, we have also designed several Digital \nAcademies entirely dedicated to women. Going forward, we aim \nto significantly increase the representation of women and other \nmarginalized groups in our Digital Academies.\n\nGoal 8: Promote sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic \ngrowth, full and productive employment and decent work for all: \nWe provide foundational digital skills through our Digital Literacy \nprograms. These skills have enabled thousands of people around \nthe world to become autonomous and either pursue higher \neducation in tech or find jobs that require basic computer skills. \nThe training provided by our Digital Academies has the sole aim \nof helping our trainees find employment. Therefore, despite the \ndifference in content and intensity, both our Digital Literacy and \nDigital Academy offerings enable our beneficiaries to become \nindependent working members of society, thereby contributing \ntowards their local economies.\n\nGoal 10: Reduce inequality within and among countries: Through \nall our Digital Literacy and Digital Academy initiatives, we equip \ndisadvantaged and marginalized people across the world with \nthe necessary means and skills to overcome their exclusion and \npursue better opportunities. We are committed to empower all \nour beneficiaries to become integrated in society with access to \nall social and economic opportunities as an equal.\n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nCorporate, social, and environmental policies and results\n\n170 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n4.\n\nPolicies and Actions\n\na)  Reducing the digital divide through Digital Literacy and \nDigital Academy\n\nI)  Digital Literacy\n\nThe first pillar of action is Digital Literacy, through which we tackle \na broad range of issues:\n\n—  we provide access to digital tools/devices to the most \nexcluded; \n\n—  we impart foundational digital skills to the digitally \nuninformed/untrained to help them take their first steps \ntowards digital autonomy; and\n\n— w e aim to raise digital awareness and inspire young people \nand women to pursue careers in Tech.\n\nSince the inception of our Digital Literacy pillar in 2019, we have \ncontinued to work with local NGO partners to empower the most \nexcluded. Compared to 2019, where we supported 27,300\xa0beneficiaries, \nthis year we have been able to help over 300,000 beneficiaries \nthrough our Digital Literacy initiatives. This was due to the strong \nmobilization of our people in supporting the enormous increase \nin demand from our NGO partners as several projects shifted \nonline in the context of the current global crisis. Our employees \nplayed a huge role in making our Digital Literacy initiatives a success; \nthey engaged in thousands across different countries to mentor/\ntrain our beneficiaries in Digital Literacy skills. The number of \npeople we were able to reach out to and impact would not have \nbeen possible without the strong mobilization of our colleagues \nand the unique conditions under which we were operating (work \nfrom home with no travel or commuting).\n\nBelow are some examples of this year’s Digital Literacy programs \nthat delivered impact against our Group targets as well as the \nobjectives set under SDG 4 and SDG 10:\n\ni.  In India, we are working with public schools that lack \nresources to provide students with experiential learning \nthrough digital platforms. Our objective is to embed STEM \nand vocational learning in the education system. This year, \nwe reached out to over 50,000\xa0students from such schools, \nusing digital tools to ensure they could continue with their \nSTEM learning during Covid-19 lockdowns.\n\nOur efforts in these schools won our India CSR team the Rotary \nKarnataka CSR Award 2020 in the “Technology in CSR/Digital \nEducation” category.\n\nii.  In Germany, we are working with Save the Children, which \noffers young people with limited access to technology new \ndigital education opportunities in their schools. This includes \ninnovative technology equipment (3D printer, laser cutter, \nVR glasses, tablets, smart classroom applications), teaching \nof technical skills, and responsible technology use.\n\niii.  In the UK, we launched a Digital Inclusion module with \nour partner, Digital Unite. This aims to help our colleagues \n(starting in the UK) understand Digital Inclusion and become \nDigital Champions who, in turn, use their skills/knowledge \nto help excluded people become digitally literate and \nautonomous.\n\niv.  Our Cloud infrastructure services (CIS) Global Business Line \nlaunched its Digital Inclusion program Digital Futures in 2020, \ntargeting digitally excluded communities in the countries \nwhere it operates. The program mobilized CIS employees \naround the world, contributing over 80,000\xa0hours to Digital \nLiteracy initiatives.\n\nv.  In India, we launched a project with NGO Tech to Lead that \ncreated learning paths by developing a digital platform called \nFirki. The platform leverages a user dashboard and incentive \nsystem to make learning more visual and interactive. Firki \nwill grow to over 350,000\xa0 users through implementation \npartnerships with non-profit organizations, universities/\ncolleges, and school leader networks, with the aim to \ncelebrate teaching and make it aspirational with increasing \nownership of self-development\n\nGoing forward, in 2021 we will continue our Digital Literacy efforts \nwith a more refined approach to increase accessibility to digital \ndevices, alongside other initiatives to reduce the digital divide. We \nhave set a target to impact at least 150,000 individuals through our \nvaried actions on Digital Literacy in 2021. We will also accelerate the \nengagement of our employees in these initiatives in the knowledge \nthat they can be real catalysts for change on this journey to bring \nthose who are digitally excluded out of their exclusion.\n\nII)  Digital Academy\n\nOur Digital Academies are centers of quality education. They deliver \nspecialized learning on IT & ITES courses where we are helping the \nmost disadvantaged young people (refugees from conflict zones, \nunder-represented women in STEM, PWDs,\xa0etc.) gain in-demand \ntech skills, enabling them to enter the new world of work. We \nbegan our journey in 2018 with our Digital Academy program \nin France, India, Netherlands and the UK. It has now become a \nglobal network of learning institutions across nine countries (now \nincluding US, Germany, Spain, Morocco and Italy).\n\nWe started with 150\xa0graduates in 2018, adding 1,562\xa0more in \n2019 (exceeding our target of 600), and in 2020 we have yet again \noverachived our target of 3,000\xa0by training 4,582\xa0people globally.\n\nWe now have over 30 Digital Academies across the world with students \nbeing trained on in-demand technology skills like DevOps, coding, \nJava, full stack developer, software testing, cloud web services, \ncyber security,\xa0etc. Below are some examples of the impact we \ndelivered through our Digital Academies in 2020:\n\ni.  In the US, we coached African American trainees through \nour Digital Academy in partnership with Per Scholas and \nSalesforce Military. \n\nii.  In Germany, we launched our first ever Digital Academy, with \nour partner AW Academy, to train people from disadvantaged \nbackgrounds. Crucially, at the end of the training, a number \nof the graduates joined Capgemini. \n\niii.  Spain launched its first Digital Academy, working with its \npartner Factoria F5 to train students from marginalized \nbackgrounds in Asturias, who embarked on a 7-month coding \ntraining program.\n\niv.  In India, our cloud infrastructure services Global Business \nLine launched a program called Sakhi Drishtikon to train \n500\xa0women from rural backgrounds on end user computing, \ncyber and cloud services. Not only did the program \nsuccessfully deliver the training, but all participants were \nhired in 2020. In 2021, the success of this program and the \nfeasibility of expanding this program will be tested.\n\nAltran have also been committed to the objectives of Digital \nAcademy and especially the need of having more women in the \nIT world. In India, Altran launched a Digital Academy called ‘She \nArise’ in partnership with Nasscom Foundation to train hundreds \nof women coming from low income backgrounds in specialized \nIT & ITES courses to enable them to find employment in the tech \nsector. Going forward, the operational integration of Altran will \nenable Capgemini not only to learn from their experience but also \nto scale up the most relevant initiatives to amplify the impact we \ncreate in communities around the world.\n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nCorporate, social, and environmental policies and results\n\nCAPGEMINI 171\n\n4.\n\nHiring & Integration of our Digital Academy graduates\n\nWe strongly believe that our graduates not only enrich the diversity \nof our own organization but also represent an alternative pool \nof diverse talent trained in top notch skills to the market. We \nhave therefore taken substantial actions this year to integrate these \ndiverse and talented graduates within our organization, either \nthrough internships or full time positions. We are confident of \ntheir potential and have made a commitment to hire at least 10% \nof our Digital Academy graduates each year, either as interns or on \npermanent contracts. The initiatives cited above in Germany (with \nAW Academy) and in India (Sakhi Drishtikon) are examples of this.\n\nIn 2020, we worked closely with our hR teams across countries and \nGlobal Business Lines and recruited 950 Digital Academy graduates \nwithin Capgemini, far exceeding our target of 300.\n\nAs an organization, we believe in collaboration and work in \npartnership with our clients and business partners to make a \nbigger impact through our Digital Academies. We have partnered \nwith JP Morgan, hSBC and AWS in India and the US to bring their \nexpertise to the program.\n\nWe are convinced that the graduates we train will become active \nprofessionals across diverse organizations and contribute to \nthe growth and improvement of their local economies. With our \nactions under these two pillars, we are playing a significant role in \nhelping the disadvantaged find employment in the new world of \nwork, leading to their social and economic inclusion.\n\nIn fact, our efforts against these objectives have won us several \nawards this year:\n\n—  the exemplary work done in India on Digital Academies has \nwon us the Indian Chamber of Commerce Award in the \n“Employment Enhancing Vocational Skills” category; and\n\n—  our Digital Academy efforts with Code your Future in the UK, \ntargeting refugees, migrants and young people coming from \ndisadvantaged areas, won us the “Best Education Project” in \nthe 2020 Global Good Awards.\n\nGoing forward, our Digital Academies will remain one of our pillars \nfor driving strong and sustainable impact in our battle to reduce \nthe digital divide. We have set ourselves the objective of training \n4,000 graduates through new Digital Academies in 2021 with \nstrengthened collaboration from our clients and business partners.\n\nb)  Leading digital inclusion with Tech for Positive Futures \nand Advocacy & thought leadership\n\nTo be leaders in Digital Inclusion we must focus on leveraging our \nstrengths in technology and innovation to solve diverse societal \nissues and create positive impact for people and the planet. While \nTech for Positive Futures (see below) does not specifically address a \nset of pre-identified SDGs, it unleashes the power of technology \nto create maximum impact against a range of different challenges \n(inequalities, climate change, biodiversity conservation, responsible \nresource consumption, better healthcare, cleaner energy,\xa0etc.).\n\nAdvocacy and thought leadership, our 4th\xa0pillar of action, is how \nwe share our knowledge and expertise on Digital Inclusion to \ninspire others to act on this topic. It is an enabler for our entire \nDigital Inclusion plan to demonstrate Capgemini’s leadership and \ncontribution on this vital topic.\n\nIII)  Tech for Positive Futures\n\nTech for Positive Futures is our 3rd\xa0pillar of action. It was launched \nin 2019 to reinforce our belief that technology and innovation can \nand should be leveraged to solve some of the world’s key societal \nand environmental challenges to create positive impact. Our Tech \nfor Positive Futures strategy is brought to life by the passionate \ncommittment of our talented people.\n\nThis year, amidst the Covid-19 crisis, we mobilized our top talent \nto develop various Tech for Positive Futures solutions tackling rising \nunemployement in countries like the UK, France and India by helping \nour Digital Inclusion partners move online.\n\ni.  In the UK, as part of our pro bono efforts, we worked with the \nPrince’s Trust to build a virtual on-boarding service enabling \nyoung people to access support remotely and continue their \nlearning. \n\nii.  In France, we are working with WeTechCare to develop a \ndigital solution that will help excluded people create CVs, \nprepare for interviews, and search and apply for jobs online. \n\niii.  In India, we recently launched an app called CapSarthi in \npartnership with NGO Sarthak. This aims to empower India’s \n100,000\xa0people with disabilities by acting as a companion to \nthem, from early intervention, through gaining employment, \nto their retirement plans.\n\niv.  In Poland, we developed a digital platform, called Cyber \nSquare, which will help excluded people to access training \nmaterial to learn basic, intermediate and advanced Digital \nLiteracy skills.\n\nAnother key highlight from this year has been our first-ever Tech \nfor Positive Futures Challenge. This engaged employees across \n15\xa0countries (92% of our headcount) in finding creative tech \nsolutions that could address existing societal problems around social \ninclusion, environment, education, health, safety and security,\xa0etc. \nThree winners from India, Australia and the UK were selected \nafter thorough deliberation by a high level jury comprising senior \nexecutives from our Group:\n\ni.  MAATR: A Java/JS Angular-based mobile application \nusing AI and Machine Learning aimed at providing a digital \nmechanism for health workers in India (called AShA workers) \nwho can give real-time care and guidance to expecting and \nnursing mothers in rural and remote areas. \n\nii.  Speechfirst: A mobile application using AI and facial \nrecognition to help stroke survivors continue their speech \nand language therapy at home on a long-term basis for \nmaximum results and recovery – at a more accessible cost.\n\niii.  Zero Hunger in Schools: An app and web-based platform to \noptimize food supply and distribution to children in need at \nschools in Australia.\n\nWe are currently in the process of supporting the build and \ndevelopment of these three social innovation ideas, which will \nbecome reality in 2021.\n\nIV)  Advocacy & thought leadership\n\nAdvocacy & thought leadership is our fourth pillar of action, in \nwhich we join forces with other responsible actors (public, private, \nnon-profit, educational institutions,\xa0etc.) to create and share \nknowledge and expertise with the common aim of reducing the \ndigital divide.\n\nThis year we published a comprehensive research document with \nthe Capgemini Research Institute – The Great Digital Divide: Why \nbringing the digitally excluded online should be a global priority. \nThis paper delved into the factors causing the digital divide and \nexamined how leaders like Capgemini can come together to bridge \nthis gap. We intend to leverage this research and our experience \nto work with our clients and business partners to create positive \nsocial impact.\n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nCorporate, social, and environmental policies and results\n\n172 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n4.\n\nWe have also joined the Business for Inclusive Growth alliance, which \nis a partnership between the OECD and a global CEO-led coalition \nof companies, including Accenture, Microsoft, Ricoh, Salesforce, and \nSchneider Electric. Our ambition is to work together on inequalities \nin income and opportunities, especially in a pandemic-hit world. \n\n(1) \n\nOne of the key areas of focus for this coalition is the reduction of \nthe digital divide, to which Capgemini has committed as a key actor, \nleveraging our existing Digital Inclusion portfolio to continue to \nhelp the most excluded.\n\nResults and Key Performance Indicators (KPI) (1)\n\n \n2021 \n\nTargetKPI 2018 2019 2020 \n\nScope C C C \n\nDigital inclusion Alignment of social impact projects towards  \ndigital inclusion\n\n64% 74% 87% 80%\n\nDigital Academy Number of Digital Academy graduates 150 1,562 4,582 (1) 4,600\n\nNumber of Digital Academy graduates  \nhired by Capgemini\n\n- - 950 (1) 460\n\nDigital Literacy Number of beneficiaries supported in  \nDigital Literacy programs\n\n- 27,300 394,209 (1) 200,000\n\n  \n\nScope: (C) stands for Capgemini legacy, (A) stands for Altran legacy and (C+A) for Capgemini and Altran.\n(1) The strong results in 2020 across our Digital Literacy and Digital Academy programs were driven by the explosion of demand from our NGO partners and the ability of our \n\ncolleagues to volunteer online in ways that will be dificult to replicate as we emerge from this crisis and adopt new ways of working.\n\nIn reference numbers published in the 2019 Universal Registration \nDocument, some of the impacts related to Digital Inclusion projects \nin India (notably regarding the number of graduates and of hires \nfrom Digital Academy in Capgemini India) were tracked in Q1 2020 \n\ndue to delays in consolidating the data at local level for Q4 2019. The \nnumbers for the same have been considered in our 2020 reporting \nand are part of the Digital Academy graduates and hires this year.\n\n4.1.3 Environmental Sustainability  \n\n2020 marks the start of a critical decade for sustainability, with \n10\xa0years left to address the UN Sustainable Development Goals \nand to halve global carbon emissions if we are to avoid the most \ndamaging impacts of climate change. The scale of the climate \nchallenge has been underlined further this year by the Covid-19 \npandemic. 2020 was a year of travel restrictions, a slowing economy, \nand reduced consumption, with many people across the globe \nconfined to their homes. Early indications suggest there was a \nrecord 7% reduction in annual global carbon emissions in 2020, \nthe sharpest drop since records began. however, to meet global \nclimate goals, we need to keep achieving at least this level of \ntransformative carbon reduction every year between now and \n2030. A challenge of this scale should matter to all businesses, \ncalling for the disruption of business models, systemic change \nand collaborative action across industries.\n\nCapgemini has a longstanding commitment to environmental \nsustainability, with a strategy that focuses on managing and \nreducing our own environmental impacts whilst deploying our \nexpertise in technology, engineering, and business transformation \nto help clients address their own sustainability challenges. Through \nour sustainability program, we are committed to contributing to \nfive UN Sustainable Development Goals and targets in particular:\n\nGoal 7, Target 2: “By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable \nenergy in the global energy mix” – we are committed to transitioning \nour own energy supply to 100% renewable electricity, to becoming \na vocal supporter of the acceleration of renewable electricity \nmarkets, and to supporting our clients in their renewable energy \ntransitions (see Section\xa04.1.3.2 for details).\n\nGoal 9, Target 4: “By 2030, upgrade infrastructure and retrofit industries \nto make them sustainable, with increased resource‑use efficiency and \ngreater adoption of clean and environmentally sound technologies and \nindustrial processes…” – we are committed to working with clients \nin both the public and private sector to increase their sustainability \nand resource-eficiency, with a target to help our clients save \n10\xa0million tonnes\xa0CO2e. Upgrading IT infrastructure, advancing \ncutting edge technology and fostering sustainable innovation are \na few examples of our client services that help advance this target \n(for other examples, see Section\xa04.1.3.3).\n\nGoal 11, Target 6:  “By 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental \nimpact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality \nand municipal and other waste management” – as a company that \nemploys 270,000\xa0people, many of whom live and work in cities, \nthe decisions we make on mobility and waste management can \nhave a global reach. We are committed to reducing the emissions \nand air pollutants associated with business travel and employee \ncommuting, as well as ensuring the sustainable management of \nwaste (see Section\xa04.1.3.2 for details).\n\nGoal 12, Target 2: “By 2030, achieve the sustainable management and \nefficient use of natural resources” – we have an impact on advancing \nresource eficiency and supporting the circular economy, primarily \nthrough the decisions on what we buy, how we use, re-use and \ndispose of resources, and how we support clients in building \ncircularity and sustainable resource management into their business \nmodels (see Section\xa04.1.3.2 and 4.1.3.3 for details).\n\nGoal 13, Target 3: “Improve education, awareness‑raising and human \nand institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, \nimpact reduction and early warning” – our sustainability program is \noriented around a goal to drive strong action on climate change. \nWe are committed to improving education, building capacity, and \nraising awareness of climate change both throughout our workforce \nand with our clients (see Section\xa04.1.3.3 for details).\n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nCorporate, social, and environmental policies and results\n\nCAPGEMINI 173\n\n4.\n\nSustainability Governance\n\nOur approach to environmental sustainability is underpinned by \nstrong governance and collective responsibility. This year, we \nestablished a new governance model to support the development \nof our net zero program:\n\nThe Net Zero Board, which meets monthly, provides executive \nlevel governance for our environmental sustainability program, \nwith responsibility for monitoring climate risks and reviewing, \ndebating, and approving climate and sustainability policies and \npractices for the Group. The Board is chaired by our sponsor, Group \nExecutive Board member and Global head of Capgemini Invent and \ncore membership includes the Chief Financial Oficer, the Chief CSR \nOficer, the Group head of Corporate Real Estate, the Group head \nof Environmental Sustainability and the CEO of Capgemini India.\n\nThe Cross Function Sustainability Committee, which meets \nmonthly, brings together a core team of sustainability sponsors \nincluding the Global head of Procurement, the Global head of \nCorporate Real Estate and the Global head of Sustainability who \ntogether monitor progress and cross-function collaboration across \nthe key streams of our net zero program.\n\nThe Net Zero Steerco, which meets weekly, brings together key \nmembers of the sustainability team to discuss weekly progress \nand ensure key actions are progressing.\n\nIn addition, the CEO, the Group Executive Committee, the Group \nExecutive Board and the Board of Directors are all consulted and \ninvolved in key decisions relating to our sustainability program. \nUltimate executive responsibility for material decisions relating \nto the program sits with the CEO, Aiman Ezzat.\n\nIn addition to this global governance, all Capgemini entities with \nISO\xa014001\xa0environmental management certification also have \ncountry or regional level governance, usually in the form of a \nCountry Board or Sustainability Board.\n\nSustainability-related recognition\n\n—  Capgemini achieved a Platinum rating in our Ecovadis CSR \nassessment, the highest possible rating with a score which \nputs us in the top 1% of organizations assessed.\n\n—  Capgemini retained our “Prime” status in the ISS ESG \nCorporate Performance index, increasing our score to \nachieve a place amongst the top 2% of highest scoring \ncompanies in our sector.\n\n—  Capgemini has been included in the S&P Global Sustainability \nYearbook 2021. This is an important recognition of our \nleadership on sustainability, with companies featured being \nthe top 15% of their industry.\n\n—  Capgemini was re-confirmed as a constituent of the Ethibel \nSustainability Index (ESI) Excellence Europe and the Ethibel \nSustainability Index (ESI) Excellence Global.\n\n—  Capgemini continued our inclusion in the STOXX ESG Leaders \nindex, which offers a representation of the leading global \ncompanies in terms of environmental, social and governance \ncriteria, based on indicators provided by Sustainalytics.\n\n—  Capgemini achieved a place of CDP’s supplier engagement \nleader board, one of only 159\xa0companies to be recognized for \nour action on corporate supply chain engagement on climate \nchange.\n\n—  Capgemini remained a constituent of the FTSE4Good Index.\n\n4.1.3.1  Climate Change\n\nCapgemini has made a commitment to achieving net zero emissions \nby 2030. This marks a significant acceleration of our climate change \nstrategy, with new elements such as a goal to power our facilities \nwith 100% renewable electricity and a focus on cutting emissions \nfrom our supply chain. Our carbon reduction program is underpinned \nby new targets that are approved by the Science Based Targets \ninitiative (SBTi) as being in line with 1.5°C climate science.\n\nOur net zero strategy builds on a strong foundation of climate \naction, with three central tenets to our climate change strategy:\n\n1.  We have a robust environmental management program \n(covered in more detail in Section\xa0 4.1.3.2), through which \nwe measure, manage and reduce our own carbon emissions, \nwith a target to achieve net zero emissions by 2030. \n\n2.  We build business resilience to climate change, with a \nrigorous Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA) process \n(covered in more detail in later in this Section), which uses \nscientific research and executive workshops to identify both \nthe physical and transition risks we face, and to prioritize \ndeveloping mitigation strategies where required.\n\n3.  We have an ambitious program to help our clients reduce \ntheir carbon emissions, by 10\xa0 million tons\xa0 CO2e by 2030 \n(covered in more detail in Section\xa04.1.3.3).\n\nApproach and Results\n\na)  Carbon reduction \n\nCapgemini has been committed to cutting its carbon emissions \nfor many years and was one of the first companies in our sector to \nhave its carbon reduction targets validated by the Science Based \nTargets initiative (SBTi). Our original headline Science-Based \ntarget, set in 2016, was to reduce our total carbon footprint per \nemployee by 20% by the end of 2020 and by 30% by the end of \n2030 (compared to a 2015 baseline). We achieved this 2030 target \nin January\xa02020, more than 10\xa0years ahead of schedule and a few \nmonths before the impacts of Covid-19 restrictions began to have \na significant reduction effect on our emissions (see Section\xa04.1.3.2 \nfor more details).\n\n2020 has been an important year for accelerating climate progress, \nwith “Action on climate change” named in January as one of the \ntop four strategic business priorities for the Group. The Covid-19 \npandemic has strengthened this focus further, accelerating virtual \ndelivery, increasing the number of client conversations about \nsustainability, and demonstrating how agile and resilient our \nteams are in the face of a crisis. In July, we launched our new net \nzero program, which covers all our operations, with three essential \ncomponents to our strategy:\n\n1.  Setting new science-based targets aligned to 1.5°C climate \nscience (see box below for further details). \n\n2.  Creating a strategy to reduce emissions in line with those \ntargets – focus areas include transitioning to renewable \nelectricity, switching to electric vehicles, increasing \nengagement with suppliers as well as a continued focus \non creating sustainable workplaces and supporting digital \ncollaboration;\n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nCorporate, social, and environmental policies and results\n\n174 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n4.\n\n3. Developing a new carbon offsetting program to offset residual \nemissions - with a focus on projects such as re-forestation \n\nwhich remove carbon emissions from the atmosphere and \ndeliver positive social impacts for local communities. \n\nScience-Based Targets aligned to 1.5°C\n\nCapgemini’s new carbon reduction targets were approved in \nOctober\xa02020 by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as \nbeing in line with the level of reduction needed to limit global \nwarming to 1.5°C (1.5°C is widely considered to be the “safe \nlimit” in terms of global temperature increases, beyond which \nwe can expect to see the most catastrophic and irreversible \nimpacts of climate change). The new targets focus on our \nhighest emitting impact areas which are business travel, \nemployee commuting, energy consumption and purchased \ngoods and services. Precisely, Capgemini’s new science-based \ntargets are as follows:\n\n—  To reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2\xa0Greenhouse Gas (GhG) \nemissions by 80% by 2030 from a 2015 base year (this will \nbe achieved by reducing ofice emissions by 80% by 2030 \nand improving the energy eficiency of our ofices by 35% \nby 2030); \n\n—  To reduce Scope 3\xa0 GhG emissions from business travel \nand employee commuting by 50% per employee by 2030 \nfrom a 2015 base year; \n\n—  To reduce absolute Scope 3\xa0 GhG emissions from \npurchased goods and services by 50% by 2030 from a \n2015 base year; and\n\n—  To increase the proportion of renewable electricity to \n100% by 2025.\n\nThe targets cover the entire Capgemini group and mark a \nsignificant step up both in terms of the scope of coverage \nand level of ambition.\n\nOur net zero program is underpinned by two key management \nsystems:\n\n—  our global Environmental Management System (EMS) that \nprovides a framework for managing the environmental \nperformance of our business (more detail is given in \nSection\xa04.1.3.2), with climate change mitigation being a key \nfocus area globally; and\n\n—  our carbon accounting system that provides a comprehensive \ndata set about our carbon impacts, with around 10\xa0 million \ndata points covering 99% of our operations, collected and \nanalyzed each year. We use this extensive data set to enable a \nvery granular view of greenhouse gas emissions, and to help \nus pinpoint opportunities to reduce emissions.\n\nFor Capgemini, having a global approach managed by a global team \nhelps ensure our data is relevant and complete, and that we have an \neficient approach for reducing our main environmental impacts.\n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nCorporate, social, and environmental policies and results\n\nCAPGEMINI 175\n\n4.\n\nResults and Key Performance Indicators (KPI):\n\n KPI Unit Scope 2015 2019 2020 Targets\n\nClimate  \nchange\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions per \nemployee (location‑based ) (1) \n\nTCO2e per  \nemployee\n\nC 3.10 2.18 0.89 √ \n\nGreenhouse gas emissions per \nemployee (location‑based )\n\nTCO2e per  \nemployee\n\nA N/A 1.83 1.12 √ \n\nGreenhouse gas emissions per \nemployee (location‑based )\n\nTCO2e per  \nemployee\n\nC+A N/A 2.11 0.94 √ \n\n% change in greenhouse gas \nemissions per employee vs  \n2015 baseline (location‑based )\n\n% C - -29.9% -71.2%  √ Target (Met in Jan \n2020): To reduce \ngreenhouse gas \n\nemissions per \nemployee by 20%  \nby 2020 and 30%  \n\nby 2030 vs 2015\n\n% change in greenhouse gas \nemissions per employee vs  \n2019 baseline (location‑based )\n\n% C - N/A -58.9% √ \n\n% change in greenhouse gas \nemissions per employee vs  \n2019 baseline (location‑based )\n\n% A N/A N/A -39.0% √ \n\n% change in greenhouse gas \nemissions per employee vs  \n2019 baseline (location‑based )\n\n% C+A N/A N/A -55.7% √ \n\n% change in scope 1 and 2 \nemissions (market-based) vs  \n2015 baseline (2) \n\n% C - -28.5% -58.9% √ Target (New target): \nTo reduce Scope 1 and \n2\xa0emissions by 80% by \n2030 vs 2015 baseline \n\n(Altran will be brought \ninto the scope of this \n\ntarget in 2021)\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nScope: (C) stands for Capgemini legacy, (A) stands for Altran legacy and (C+A) for Capgemini and Altran.\n√ Data identified in these tables by a √ has been reviewed by Mazars with a reasonable level of assurance.\nN/A Data for Altran for 2015 is not yet fully calculated so has been excluded from these tables.\n(1) Greenhouse gas emissions per employee includes all Scope 1\xa0emissions, Scope 2 location‑based emissions and Scope 3\xa0emissions from business travel, electricity T&D losses, \n\nwaste disposal and water consumption.\n(2) Scope 1\xa0emissions relate to direct emissions from buildings or assets – for Capgemini this includes fuel consumption and fluorinated gas used in air conditioning units of \n\nthe ofices and data centers under the Company’s operational control.

The diverse and agile \nnature of our business, serving a wide range of sectors with a \nvaried portfolio of services, gives us some protection in terms of \nour exposure to climate risks. however, we recognize that the level \nof climate-related risks will escalate in the coming years.\n\nConsequently, it is essential that we take steps to understand and \nbuild resilience to climate risks. In 2020, Capgemini re-launched \nour Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA) process with stronger \nalignment to the recommendations from the TCFD. Specifically, \nwe revised our CCRA process first implemented in 2016 with a \nstronger focus on transition risks and climate-related scenario \nanalysis, and with increased integration into our corporate risk \nmanagement processes.\n\nWith the impacts of climate change varying significantly by geographic \nregion, we have retained a focus on assessing climate risks at a \ncountry level. In 2020, we began deploying the new CCRA process \nin our largest markets, starting with Germany, North America and \nIndia. The process consists of five key stages:\n\n1.  Preliminary analysis – using publications from the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the \nInternational Energy Agency, as well as government reports \nand credible scientific journals, we conduct a preliminary \nassessment of the physical climate hazards in each country, \nthe climate transition plans and the policy and public \nsentiment with regards to climate change. We then analyze \nthe climate risks and opportunities facing key sectors or \nkey clients that we serve within a country, to understand \npotential knock-on impacts for Capgemini. We focus on \ncompiling findings and potential risks that are aligned with \nthe following scenarios:\n\n—  A Rapid Climate Transformation 1.5°C scenario – where \nstrong, rapid transformation to a low carbon society \ntakes place, driven by governments globally and with a \nstrong push from consumers and society to tackling the \nissue. In this scenario, global temperature increases are \nheld at 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels by 2100.\n\n—  A Paris Alignment 2°C scenario – where governments \ncommit to and deliver action in line with the Paris Climate \nChange Agreement and the private sector plays an \n\nimportant role in accelerating progress. In this scenario, \nglobal temperature increases are held at 2°C above \npre-industrial levels by 2100, with significantly stronger \nphysical impacts experienced compared to 1.5°C.\n\n—  A Climate Action Rejection 4°C scenario– where action \nto mitigate climate change is not taken unilaterally, and \nthe more extreme physical effects of climate change \ncome into effect contributing to increased conflict and \nmass migration. Investment in climate mitigation is slow \nand therefore countries must invest to adapting to the \nconsequences of climate change.\n\nThe scenarios are deliberately distinct and help us to test out a \nrange of possible futures and analyze what their impact could \nbe for our business and our strategy– as a starting point we \nfocus on describing the potential risks in a “maximum impact” \nscenario; for example, when considering carbon pricing, we would \nconsider the likely carbon price in a 1.5°C or 2°C scenario where \npolicies are likely to be stronger, whereas when analyzing the \nincreased prevalence of extreme weather, we would use a 4°C \nscenario to take into account more extreme physical impacts.\n\n2.  Risk identification workshop – once the preliminary analysis \nis complete, we invite a selection of key internal stakeholders \nfrom the country leadership team to take part in a series of \nworkshops. Participants would usually include the Chief of \nOperations, the Legal Financial Director, the heads of Risk, \nProcurement, hR, Corporate Real Estate and CSR, as well \nas representation from key market units and key business \nareas. The initial workshop takes the participants through \nthe findings from the preliminary analysis and invites them \nto share their personal experience when it comes to climate \nimpacts and their views on potential risks and opportunities \nfor Capgemini. Through facilitated discussion, we define and \nshortlist a series of potentially relevant risk scenarios.\n\n3.  Risk assessment – after the risk identification workshop, we \nask the same set of stakeholders to review the risk scenarios \nidentified and conduct their own qualitative assessment of \nthe maximum plausible impact of each risk scenario and the \nlikelihood of this maximum impact being experienced. We \nask them to conduct this process using a very similar set of \ncriteria we use for all internal risk assessment, in particular, \nthe focus is on the potential impact of the risk scenario on \nthe following dimensions: strategy and objectives, human \nresources, operations, reputation and finances.\n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nCorporate, social, and environmental policies and results\n\nCAPGEMINI 177\n\n4.\n\n4.  Risk prioritization workshop – we bring all the stakeholders \nback together for a final workshop, where we review the \nresults of the risk assessment together, modify any risk \ndefinitions that are unclear and group together risks that are \nvery similar or that will be managed by the same person. We \nagree on a threshold to help define which risks to prioritize \nimmediately for developing and strengthening mitigation \nactions and which risks should be registered and monitored \non an ongoing basis.\n\n5.  Risk mitigation planning – risk owners are identified for \neach risk and a control plan is developed that describes the \nrisk scenario in more detail, the potential impacts (including \nfinancial impacts), the current control measures and any new \ncontrol measures needed. This risk control template is then \nintegrated into the risk management systems and monitored \non an ongoing basis.\n\nThe findings from this process are presented to the Country Board \nor equivalent management team, who are ultimately responsible \nfor ensuring climate risks and opportunities identified at a country \nlevel are managed appropriately. They also feed into a global review \nand help to inform business continuity planning. In addition, climate \nchange risks are considered as part of the Group Risk Management \nReview (see Section\xa03.2.2), with all interviewees asked to assess \nthe relevance of climate risks in each TCFD category.\n\nThe most material climate-related risk identified at Group level \nis the potential increase in natural disasters, particularly in India \nwhere half of our workforce are located and where power and \ntelecommunications networks are more vulnerable to extreme \nweather. This has been identified as a critical risk for the Capgemini \ngroup for the last few years and it is noted that both the likelihood \nand the impact of this risk are expected to increase due to climate \nchange. If not managed appropriately, this risk could cause significant \ndisruption to our operations, our workforce and our business \ncontinuity. For further details on this risk, its potential impacts \nand how it is being managed please see Section\xa03.2.1.\n\n4.1.3.2  Environmental Management \n\nAs a global company operating in over 40\xa0countries around the \nworld, we need to ensure we have rigorous procedures in place \nto manage and reduce our environmental impacts and respond to \nan increasingly complex landscape of legislation and stakeholder \nexpectations. We have a robust Environmental Management \nSystem (EMS) to help each Capgemini entity identify and manage its \nenvironmental impacts, as well as act to reduce them and ensure we \nmeet Group-wide targets as well as local stakeholder expectations.\n\nOur most material operational environmental impacts result from \nour use of energy in our facilities, our business-related travel, \nthe commuting employees do from their home to the office, \nthe disposal of ofice waste, and from the goods and services \nwe buy. We are committed to driving eficiency and innovation \nacross these impact areas. Smaller impact areas like water supply \n& treatment, and fugitive air-conditioning emissions are measured \nand reported on an ongoing basis and prioritized at a country level \nwhere material. Other environmental impacts, such as those on \nbiodiversity, land use, noise pollution and the sourcing of raw \nmaterials, while regularly reviewed, are not currently significantly \nconsidered material to our operations, and consequently are not \ndiscussed further in this report.\n\nApproach and Results\n\na)  A Global Environmental Management System\n\nhaving an Environmental Management System is not only a way \nof monitoring legal compliance, it also provides a framework for \ntransforming our environmental performance as a business, and \nensures we have the right measures and governance to manage our \noperations eficiently. Capgemini has a global ISO\xa014001\xa0certificate \nfor its Environmental Management System (EMS), which is built on \nover a decade of experience in environmental management. Our \nCapgemini EMS is delivered by a Global Sustainability Center of \nExcellence, environmental experts who make sure that we manage \nall our environmental risks and impacts effectively and remain \ncompliant with all legal and regulatory requirements.\n\nThe Capgemini global ISO\xa014001\xa0Environmental Management \nSystem now supports operations in 28\xa0 countries, covering \n212,321\xa0employees. In addition, Capgemini Portugal has retained \nan individual ISO\xa014001\xa0certificate covering all or part of their \noperations, meaning that 97.8% of Capgemini’s business by headcount \nis covered. In addition, our Altran business has ISO\xa014001\xa0certification \nat several strategic sites, covering 33% of the Altran headcount. \nThis means that overall, 86% of the Capgemini group is certified \nunder ISO\xa014001. We are committed to bringing Altran fully into \nthe scope of our global certificate and have begun this process \nwith the inclusion of Altran facilities in the Netherlands within the \nscope of our global certification.\n\nIn addition, the business holds a global ISO\xa050001\xa0certificate for \nenergy management covering France, Netherlands and the UK, \nwith India holding a local certificate. 2020 also saw the deployment \nof ISO\xa045001\xa0certification for health and Safety management in \nGermany leveraging the global EMS platform. Further expansion \nof ISO\xa050001 and ISO\xa045001\xa0is planned for 2021.\n\nOur Environmental Policy sets out the minimum measures required \nby all Capgemini entities in support of our Global Environmental \nSustainability program. It is available here: https://www.capgemini.\ncom/resources/group-environmental-policy.\n\nb)  Sustainable, energy efficient workplaces\n\nWe are committed to creating sustainable and energy-eficient \nworkplaces which are good for both our people and the environment. \nThis starts with strong environmental design, with several flagship \nbuildings across India, France, Germany, Poland, Spain and Sweden \ncertified under LEED, IGBC, BREEAM or equivalent green building \naccreditations. A new focus for Capgemini in 2020 has been on \nidentifying ways to embed sustainability into our contracts at \nstrategic sites. Through a collaboration with corporate real estate \nteams, procurement, our landlords and property brokers, we have \ndeveloped new sustainability selection criteria to be applied when \nchoosing buildings as well as renewing leases. These cover topics \nincluding renewable energy, energy eficiency and monitoring, \nsustainability accreditation, electric vehicle charging points and \nproximity to public transport.\n\nAcross our estate, we have already progressed a range of eficiency \nmeasures to reduce energy and water use, embrace new technology \nand prompt employees into action, with a focus on four key areas:\n\nhttps://www.capgemini.com/resources/group-environmental-policy\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nCorporate, social, and environmental policies and results\n\n178 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n4.\n\n1.  The deployment of the latest technologies, such as highly \neficient air handling units, modular uninterruptible power \nsupplies, LED lighting and precision air conditioning. \n\n2.  The smart management of lighting, heating, and cooling \nsystems, through Building Management Systems, smart \nmetering and the development of energy control centers. \n\n3.  Optimizing the use of our floor space to support safe and \ncollaborative workspaces.\n\n4.  Promoting behavior change initiatives to encourage our \npeople to save energy on-site, such as switch-off campaigns \nand networks of sustainability champions.\n\nWe have committed to continuing to drive progress further, with \na new target (covering both Capgemini and Altran) to improve \nenergy eficiency (in kWh per\xa0m²) by 25% by 2022 and 35% by 2030 \n(vs a 2015 baseline).\n\nThroughout the Covid-19 pandemic, the majority of our ofices \nhave remained partially open to support essential client services \n\nor employees who are unable to work from home. however, \nsignificant efforts have been made to minimize energy consumption, \nby shutting down areas within the buildings and keeping heating \nand cooling to a minimum in unutilized areas. As such, our total \nenergy consumption was down 29% in 2020 (vs 2019), driven by a \n33% reduction in ofice energy consumption and a 16% reduction \nin data center energy consumption.\n\nIn Capgemini entities in France, UK and Netherlands, the development \nof an energy management system certified under ISO\xa050001\xa0has \nbeen a vital step in managing and reducing energy consumption. \nIn India, which is home to nearly half of our workforce and ofice \nspace, we have focused on developing a very energy eficient estate, \nwith all 9\xa0major Capgemini campuses certified as “Platinum” under \nthe Indian Green Building Council (IGBC) and US Green Building \nCouncil (USGBC) schemes. In addition, our Pune Talwade campus \nrecently received the’Performance Challenge for Green Built \nEnvironment’ award at the Green Building Congress conducted in \nlate October\xa02020. Five key areas of focus have helped Capgemini \nIndia create more sustainable workplaces in 2020:\n\nCase Study Capgemini India: Five steps to creating more sustainable workplaces\n\nSwitching to  \nsmart solar\n\nReturning surplus  \nenergy \n\nCutting down on  \nwater waste\n\nRecycling organic  \nwaste\n\nGifting re‑usable  \nbottles\n\nSolar panels adorn roofs, \ngazebos, pedestrian \nwalkways and car ports \nacross nine sites in India. \nThere is even a solar-\npowered amphitheatre and \nsolar “trees” for employees \nto shade under. At our site  \nin Chennai, smart light \nsensors enable the solar \npanels to re-orient towards \nthe sun all day, maximising \nthe power generated.\n\nWith the COVID pandemic \nincreasing the amount of \nworking from home, surplus \nenergy from on site solar \nplants at Benguluru and \nhyderabad are returning \nsurplus electricity to the \ngrid, enough to power 100 \nhouseholds by the end of \n2020.  \n\nA membrane-based \ntreatment system avoids \nthe need for taking waste \nwater off-site, with waste \nwater treated and reused \nfor watering gardens and \nflushing toilets  \n\nOn-site converters turn \norganic waste into compost, \nwhich is used fertilise the \ngarden areas or offered to \nemployees to take home. \nKitchen waste is converted \nto bio-gas and used for \ncooking. \n\nAt the start of 2020, all \nCapgemini colleagues in \nIndia were given a branded \nre-usable drinks bottle. \nThis not only reduced the \namount of single-use plastic \nwater bottles brought \nonto – and disposed of – on \ncampuses, but also greatly \nreduced the amount of \ntap water used to wash \nglassware. With 120,000 \nemployees across India, it’s a \nsmall change that has made \na big impact.\n\nWithin Altran India too, a strong focus on energy eficiency has \nhelped deliver energy and carbon savings, In 2020, efforts focused \non optimizing the ofice space, consolidating Uninterruptible Power \nSupplies (UPS) and the installation of small air conditioning units in \nlab facilities to reduce the need for night-time use of central chillers.\n\nc)  Switching to renewable energy\n\nIn 2020, we made a commitment to transition the entire Capgemini \ngroup (including Altran) to 100% renewable electricity by 2025. This \nbuilds on several years progress in investing in cleaner and more \nsustainable energy. It also aligns with our commitment to tackle \nUN Sustainable Development Goal 7\xa0Target 2\xa0which is “to increase \nsubstantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix”. \nWhilst we may not be a major energy user, with over 400\xa0facilities \naround the globe our renewable energy strategy still has an impact. \nWe are increasing this impact further through the work we do \nwith our Energy & Utilities clients, helping them transform their \nenergy mix to renewables. In 2020, we also became a signatory to \nthe RE100, joining a collective of over 280\xa0influential companies \nto push for the acceleration of renewable electricity policies and \nmarkets. This gives us an opportunity to play a more vocal role in \naccelerating the renewable energy transition.\n\nThere are three main priorities to our new renewable energy strategy:\n\n1.  Continuing to scale up solar capacity at our ofices in India, \nwhere we have the greatest potential both in terms of scale \nand the amount of sunlight available. \n\n2.  Securing renewable Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) \nin areas where our electricity consumption is of suficient \nvolumes.\n\n3.  Pursuing renewable electricity contracts backed up by \nGuarantee of Origin certificates where these are available \n(in Europe) or high quality renewable certificates where no \nother options exist.\n\n2020 saw the continued evolution of our renewable energy \nportfolio, with 49% of electricity consumed by Capgemini and \n27% by Altran coming from renewable sources. Capgemini Italy, \nCapgemini Spain and Altran France joined several other entities \nacross Europe in switching to renewable electricity contracts. For \nCapgemini India, 31% of electricity in 2020 came from renewable \nsources with around 8,000\xa0MWh generated on site in 2020, most \nof which was directly consumed in our ofices, with 370MWh in \ncapacity exported to the grid this year as we generated more than \nwe could use. A further 15,153\xa0MWh was purchased from off-site \nsolar and wind farms through a PPA.\n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nCorporate, social, and environmental policies and results\n\nCAPGEMINI 179\n\n4.\n\nd)  Sustainable travel & mobility\n\nThe travel we undertake as a business contributes significantly to \nour greenhouse gas emissions, as well as being a source of other air \npollutants such as\xa0NOx and diesel particulates. A high proportion \nof our workforce live and work in urban areas, which often have \nsignificant levels of air pollution. As such, we are committed to \nplaying a role in reducing the environmental impacts associated \nwith having a highly mobile workforce. This is aligned to our \ncommitment to impacting UN SDG target 11.6 “to reduce the adverse \nper capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special \nattention to air quality and municipal and other waste management”.\n\nThis year was not a typical year for the Group, with the Covid-19 \npandemic dramatically reducing our business travel emissions \nper employee by 69% compared to 2019 (taking into account \nboth Capgemini and Altran). 2020 saw the rapid acceleration of \nvirtual delivery, with more than 90% of our employees working \nfrom home at various points throughout the year. Whilst meeting \nour clients and teams face-to-face remains important to building \nrelationships, we are determined to leverage the learnings from the \nCovid-19 pandemic to create a new and more sustainable delivery \nmodel for the future. To help focus our efforts in this area, we set \ntwo new global targets this year (covering Capgemini and Altran):\n\n1.  To reduce business travel emissions per employee by 38% in \n2025 and 50% in 2030 (vs 2015).\n\n2.  To reduce commuting emissions per employee by 35% in \n2025 and 50% in 2030 (vs 2015).\n\nIn November\xa02020, our Accelerated Solutions Environment (ASE) \nhosted a virtual three-day event that brought together key business \nleaders from Procurement, Finance, CSR, Corporate Real Estate, \nSecurity, People Safety and human Resources, as well as external \ntravel consultants, to design a new Capgemini Global Travel Policy, \nputting sustainability at its core. The new policy that will be launched \nin 2021 incorporates a strong set of sustainability principles, guiding \nemployees on if and how to travel.\n\nWe have also developed a comprehensive strategy to transition \ncompany cars (both Capgemini and Altran) to electric vehicles as \nsoon as possible, starting by ensuring 100% of the cars offered \nto employees in our catalogues are electric and hybrid. We have \nalready seen a rapid increase in the uptake of electric vehicles in \nthe Netherlands and the UK.\n\nThe pandemic has demonstrated the strength of our virtual \ncollaboration capabilities. The transition to home working was \ndelivered rapidly and eficiently, including in business areas where \nhome working had previously been very rare. Video conferencing \nhelped retain a vital connection between employees and discussion \nforums on Microsoft Teams helped build collective morale and \nsupport between employees (professional and personal tips \non managing dificulties related to the pandemic for instance). \nThroughout 2020, we also provided extensive support to our \nclients to transform their operations to virtual delivery and help \nsteer them through the crisis. This includes a number of pro bono \nprojects such as the development of Telehealth Toolbox by Altran \nsubsidiary Frog Design, helping doctors to accelerate the transition \nto providing telehealth and virtual support for patients.\n\nAt a country level, Capgemini UK won the ‘Environmental Behavior \nChange Campaign of the Year’ in the 2020 Global Good Awards \nfor its ConnectWell program. ConnectWell is a long-standing \nprogram that has brought together training, digital tools, employee \nambassadors and change agents to drive down carbon emissions, \nimprove work-life harmony and transform the way we work with \nclients. In 2020, Capgemini UK delivered 15\xa0digital sessions on \nvirtual collaboration reaching almost 620\xa0people and produced \ntwo virtual collaboration playbooks – one focused on virtual \nmanagement and another on virtual delivery.\n\nIn many countries, including Spain and the Netherlands, Capgemini \nhas focused on providing extensive support for adapting to \nhome working with the provision of chairs, monitors and other IT \nequipment to employees. In addition, many ofices (for example: \nBarcelona) are being remodeled to support a more flexible approach \nto working in the ofice, with the expectation that home working \nwill continue into the future. Capgemini Belgium has had a strong \nfocus on virtualizing large events successfully including Belgian \nManagement Update Meetings (with 100+ attendees), client \nwebinars and virtual press conferences or “Pressinars”.\n\nAs part of European Mobility Week, Altran Italy launched an \nawareness campaign asking employees to contribute photos of \nthemselves travelling sustainably, with the collected material \npublished in the internal newsletter.\n\ne)  Waste management and circular economy\n\nManaging our waste effectively is important in terms of minimizing \nour use of finite natural resources, as well as being a tangible, \nimpactful way of demonstrating our environmental commitments \nto our people. The most eficient way of reducing the environmental \nimpacts from waste is not to generate waste in the first place. At the \nheart of the concept of “circular economy” is the idea of effectively \n“closing the loop” – maintaining products and materials in a cyclical \nuse phase so that waste is effectively designed out of the system.\n\nWe are committed to playing a role in supporting UN Sustainable \nDevelopment Goal 12\xa0Target 2\xa0to “achieve the sustainable management \nand efficient use of natural resources”. As such, we have sought to \napply the principles of circular economy to our own operations in \nnumerous ways, from innovative e-waste partnerships enabling \nreuse of laptops and mobile phones, to local initiatives such as \nswapping disposable cups with reusable ones or replacing paper \ntowels by high-eficiency hand driers. We also look for opportunities \nto partner with charities and universities to reuse stationary, \nfurniture and IT equipment. In 2020, Altran India deployed a new \nmobile app “Youtility” to help improve management of routine tasks \nand replace the need for printing out paper checklists. This has \nsaved an estimated 28,000\xa0A4 paper sheets, reduced the amount \nof waste being generated and improved the eficiency of routine \nmaintenance operations.\n\nOverall, 2020 has posed a major challenge in terms of waste and \nsustainable management of resources. Whilst our waste volumes \nhave overall reduced by 36% due to lower numbers of people using \nour ofices, we have had to work hard to balance our focus on \nsustainability with increased hygiene concerns supporting Covid-19. \nAll corporate real estate teams have made significant efforts to \ncarefully check and consider where single-use, disposable items \nare essential for minimizing potential for Covid-19 transmission, \nor where more sustainable alternatives may be viable. Whilst our \ntarget to phase out single-use plastics has had to be postponed \nuntil the Covid-19 pandemic has passed, our teams continue to \nshow a strong personal awareness and commitment to addressing \nthis challenge.\n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nCorporate, social, and environmental policies and results\n\n180 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n4.\n\nThis personal commitment is also seen in the high level of participation \nfrom employees in waste-related events run this year:\n\n—  Capgemini Germany launched a team of plastic pioneers or \nambassadors – employees who had personally pledged to \nreduce their use of plastic and share their stories to inspire \nothers. In support of the World Cleanup movement, cleanup \nactivities were also organized in Berlin, Frankfurt, Cologne \nand Nuremberg. Over 80\xa0employees took part in efforts to \nclear roads and parks, organized in cooperation with urban \nwaste management service providers; \n\n—  Capgemini Italy organized a Cleanup Day in September that \nwas attended by 80\xa0 employees across six cities, with over \n700\xa0kg of waste collected; \n\n—  Altran Ukraine organized collection boxes for unwanted \nclothing and old batteries, collecting 214kg of clothing for \ndonation to charity and recycling and 60kg of batteries for \nrecycling; and\n\n—  Capgemini France and Capgemini North America focused \nefforts on teaching employees to compost food waste. In \nNorth America, a “Composting Challenge” was held with \n41\xa0 employees (most first-time composters) taught how to \ncompost food waste effectively and then set the challenge of \ncomposting as much food waste as possible over a two-week \nperiod – in total 98\xa0kg of food waste were saved from landfill.\n\nKey Performance Indicators for Environmental Management (KPI)\n\nKPI Unit Scope 2015 2019 2020 Targets\n\nShare of operations  \ncovered by ISO 14001 \ncertification\n\n% operations by \nheadcount √\n\nC 76.0% 91.4% 97.8% √ Target (Met): all Capgemini \nentities with a headcount \n\nof over 1,000\xa0people to be \nISO\xa014001\xa0certified by the end of \n\n2020\n\nA N/A 31.1% 32.7% √ N/A\n\nC+A N/A 80.0% 85.9% √ N/A\n\nOffice energy efficiency kWh/m² C 169.1 134.1 83.7 √ N/A\n\nA N/A 147.3 116.6 √ N/A\n\nC+A N/A 136.5 89.5 √ Target (New): to reduce ofice energy \nconsumption per\xa0m² by 25% by 2022 \n\nand 35% by 2030 vs a 2015 baseline\n\n% of electricity from \nrenewable sources\n\n% C 27.4% 40.2% 49.4% √ \n\nA N/A 17.7% 26.5% √ \n\nC+A N/A 36.8% 45.6% √ Target (New): to increase the \nproportion of electricity from \n\nrenewable sources to 100% by 2025\n\nBusiness travel emissions  \nper employee\n\nTCO2e per  \nemployee\n\nC 1.74 1.36 0.39 √ \n\nA N/A 1.08 0.50 √ \n\nC+A N/A 1.31 0.41 √ Target (New): to reduce business \ntravel emissions per employee by 38% \n\nby 2025 and 50% by 2030 vs a 2015 \nbaseline\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nScope: (C) stands for Capgemini legacy, (A) stands for Altran legacy and (C+A) for Capgemini and Altran.\n√ Data identified in these tables by a √ has been reviewed by Mazars with a reasonable level of assurance.\n\nf)  Using Data to Drive Performance\n\nWe are committed to continuously improving the quality of our \ndata collection and analysis and to using these insights to make \nstrategic decisions. This means having comprehensive data, with \ndata coverage (including both Capgemini and Altran) reaching \n98.6% of our operations by headcount. having one centralized team \nand system responsible for gathering, processing, and reporting \ndata helps us maintain a high level of consistency and data quality.\n\nIn 2020, our focus has been on integrating environmental data \nfrom Altran into Capgemini’s carbon accounting processes with \noperations in Ukraine added to our reporting for the first time. \nWe continue to capture and report data monthly for around \n70% of Capgemini’s emissions (or around 60% for Capgemini and \nAltran emissions), enabling faster engagement with the data and \nresults. We also maintain a series of interactive dashboards for our \nsustainability and corporate real estate communities to engage \nwith the data. Data from our carbon accounting system also feeds \n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nCorporate, social, and environmental policies and results\n\nCAPGEMINI 181\n\n4.\n\ninto other systems and processes. For example, Capgemini UK has \ncreated a Carbon Travel Dashboard, a web-based reporting tool \nthat enables Capgemini’s clients facing teams to track and manage \nboth the costs and emissions associated with business travels. It \nprovides a detailed breakdown of carbon data, enabling account \n\nexecutives to make informed decisions to help reduce their teams’ \ncarbon footprint and also engage directly with their clients on the \nenvironmental travel impacts of engagements.

Details of the methodology are provided in methodology Section of the Chapter.\n (3) A s recommended by the GhG Protocol, emissions of Fluorinated Gas (F-gas) not covered by the Kyoto Protocol such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are not reported as \n\nScope 1\xa0emissions and are therefore not included above. These F-gas emissions are, however, captured with a value of 1,485\xa0tons of\xa0CO2e for 2020.\n(4) F  -gas data is currently provided for operations covering 56.3% of the total headcount. For remaining operations, F-gas data is currently not available – this is in part due to \n\nthe fact that we lease many shared buildings, where we do not have full control of the maintenance of air conditioning systems.\n (5) O ur business travel emissions are calculated including the impact of radiative forcing for air travel, as well as the impact of hotel night stays. Whilst this is recommended \n\nbest practice, many companies in our sector do not yet include these two emission sources and therefore caution should be applied trying to compare Capgemini’s business \ntravel emissions to those of other companies in our sector.\n\n (6)  “Renewable Electricity” denotes all renewable electricity purchased at renewable energy tariffs or through renewable energy certificates and a small amount of energy \ngenerated on-site in India and the UK through solar photovoltaic panels. “Other electricity” means purchased electricity generated from other sources (nuclear or fossil fuels).\n\n (7) O ur waste emissions increased significantly in 2020, despite the volume of waste being reduced. This is due to an update to the BEIS emissions factors with the emissions \nassociated with landfilled waste more than four times higher in 2020 than in 2019.\n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nCorporate, social, and environmental policies and results\n\n182 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n4.\n\n4.1.3.3  Increasing our Sustainability Impact\n\nAs a global leader in consulting, digital transformation, technology, \nand Engineering Services, we are in a strong position to transform \nthe way our industry thinks about sustainability and to ensure \nthat the maximum positive impact is achieved for the planet. We \nwork with our clients to help them reduce their greenhouse gas \nemissions and to support and accelerate their transition towards \na low carbon future. Through our client sustainability program \nand employee engagement activities, we are helping advance UN \nSDG Target 13.3\xa0to “Improve education, awareness‑raising and human \nand institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, \nimpact reduction and early warning”.\n\nApproach and Results\n\nThroughout 2020, we continued to build the momentum behind our \nclient sustainability program and employee engagement activities, \nfocusing on how we innovate with our clients, show leadership \nwithin our industry and harness the enthusiasm of our employees.\n\na)  Innovate\n\nInnovation within our industry forms a vital role in helping shape \nthe solution for not just today but for the future and is an integral \npart of our client’s net zero strategies. Throughout 2020 we have \nleveraged our capabilities in numerous ways:\n\nMeasuring carbon impacts\n\n1.  We have developed a Client Carbon Impact Calculator and \nassociated methodology to provide a transparent carbon \nimpact of client projects. We have focused on both positive \ncarbon impacts i.e. what potential does the project have \nfor reducing the client’s emissions and negative impacts \ni.e. what is the carbon impact associated with the delivery \nof the project – in terms of business travel, home working, \ncommuting, ofice energy consumption, and the digital or \ndata center footprint (in terms of virtual conferencing, email \nand online storage).\n\n2.  We have developed a new process for defining the carbon \nimpact of a bid, in order to increase engagement with clients \non sustainability and optimizing delivery models.\n\nDeveloping client solutions\n\nCapgemini has a wide range of capabilities which can support \nclients with sustainability challenges from business strategy \nconsulting and deep data analytics to designing sustainable IT \narchitectures and implementation. A few examples of recent \nprojects are included below:\n\n1.  Go Zero – Transportation and mobility are a significant \nsource of emissions globally. Many businesses struggle \nto leverage existing mobility data for positive behavioral \nand environmental change, with a disconnect between an \norganization’s climate goals and the ability of an individual \nemployee to drive change. Go Zero is a mobility intelligence \nplatform that Capgemini has developed, allowing individuals \nand businesses to come together to reduce travel emissions. \nAn easy-to-use mobile service allows organizations and \nindividuals to visualize and track their impacts and make \nmore sustainable mobility choices.\n\n2.  Citroën AMI – Altran collaborated with Groupe PSA to create \nthe Citroën AMI, its new mobility solution, a light electric \nvehicle designed for short-distance urban mobility. Based on \nrequirements defined by PSA, Altran led the development \nprocess, from both technical and industrial perspectives, \nfrom design to purchasing, as well as vehicle and process \nengineering, and even creation of the production line. To \nsuccessfully carry out this unique project, Altran called upon \n100\xa0 experts organized in multidisciplinary, international \nteams.\n\n3.  Vertical Farming – A concept created by Capgemini’s Applied \nInnovation Exchange in London. Beyond Farms is an online \nmarketplace that connects vertical farm providers with \nprospective farmers and conscious consumers who want \nto buy locally grown produce. Beyond Farms’ mission is to \ndiversify the growth of vegetables and fruits to small, local \nvertical farms in densely populated areas and reduce the \namount of food miles that produce has to travel. Food that has \nbeen sustainably grown can be ordered directly from farms \nand then delivered through a digital service that provides \ndetailed information about where and how the product has \nbeen grown, enabling more conscious consumption.\n\n4. hyperloopTT – Altran has mobilized its Toulouse-based \nTechnology Engineering Center to support hyperloopTT \nin developing the “train of tomorrow”. Altran provides all \nthe technical skills hyperloopTT requires, ranging from \nmechanical and physical engineering to systems architecture \nand software development, as well as performance. Several \ndozens of Toulouse-based engineers participate in the project \nto develop hyperloopTT innovative and forward-looking \ntransportation system. In addition, Altran’s innovation \ncenters will contribute their comprehensive technological \nexpertise in support of this pioneering initiative.\n\n5.  VeriTherm smart thermal measurement – Altran’s subsidiary \nCambridge Consultants worked with built-environment \ncleantech specialists Redbarn Group to develop digital \nservice innovation to transform building performance. The \nbreakthrough digital service offers a viable thermal test for \nevery commercially developed property.\n\n6.  FS Sustainability Proposition – This proposition has been \ndeveloped to explore the role of the Financial Services sector \nin tackling climate change and the opportunity for Financial \nServices to accelerate sustainability. It provides an insight \ninto emerging concepts we can use to inspire and custom \nbuild for clients.\n\nb)  Thought leadership \n\nCapgemini has a long tradition in producing high quality thought \nleadership. Through our award winning Capgemini Research Institute, \nsustainability has been a key theme of many of the research projects \nundertaken in 2020. Some of the key publications this year included:\n\n The Automotive Industry in the Era of Sustainability\n\nWith growing concerns about climate change and environmental \ndegradation, sustainability has become a strategic priority for \nautomotive organizations. Governments, consumers, and investors \nare now pushing automotive organizations to change their ways \nof working, culture, and products. This will have far-reaching \nimplications for the industry, which despite having made substantial \nprogress, still needs to step up its sustainability efforts.\n\nThis report considers where the industry stands today in terms of \nits sustainability initiatives and what does the future hold.\n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nCorporate, social, and environmental policies and results\n\nCAPGEMINI 183\n\n4.\n\n How sustainability is fundamentally changing consumer \npreferences\n\nAs the hands of the Doomsday Clock inch towards midnight and \nconsequences of climate change, pollution, biodiversity loss, and \nresource scarcity become impossible to ignore, people are waking \nup to the urgent need for change. Together with governments, \npublic-interest groups, investors, competitors, and employees, \nconsumers are increasingly calling for a more sustainable, \nenvironmentally friendly, socially responsible, and economically \ninclusive tomorrow.\n\nThis report considers whether Consumer Products and Retail (CPR) \norganizations are heeding this call.\n\n Powering sustainability – why energy and utility companies \nneed to view sustainability as an opportunity\n\nNearly three-quarters of global greenhouse gas emissions are \ncaused by energy use, adding a lot of responsibility to the energy \nand utilities industry towards reducing emissions. Given the state \nof the environment, this situation is not tenable, and the sector \nmust urgently implement affordable, reliable sources of clean \nenergy while decarbonizing its value chain. The challenge is huge \nbut the advantages of meeting it are many – not least of which is \nsaving our planet.\n\nThis report explores how organizations that are driving the \nsustainability agenda are reaping the rewards, where they are \nfalling behind, and what they can do to pick up the pace.\n\nClimate AI – How AI can cut carbon\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) powered use cases for climate action \nhave the potential to help organizations fulfil up to 45% of their \nEconomic Emission Intensity (EEI) targets of the Paris Agreement. \nThis research conducted in partnership with climate change start-up \nRight. Based on Science; explores how AI offers many climate action \nuse cases which could be scaled rapidly. The report investigates \nhow deployment is proving elusive with just 13% of organizations \nsuccessfully combining climate vision with AI capabilities.\n\nc)  Educate, engage and empower\n\nOur environmental program is underpinned by a strong focus \non engaging our team members. As a business, we are focused \non creating a culture where individual sustainable actions are \nnormalized, and people are empowered to make a difference to \nproblems that matter to them. Our approach to mobilizing our \npeople includes a focus on three areas: education, engagement \nand empowerment.\n\nWe have developed practical guides, briefing packs and computer-based \ntraining modules to enhance the collective sustainability knowledge \nof our people. With engagement campaigns, we apply a ‘360-degree’ \napproach to our programs considering policies, infrastructures, and \ninformation to enable and encourage people to make sustainable \nchoices.\n\nEducate\n\nAt a global level, we have developed targeted awareness programs \naround the impacts of technology and how it can drive positive \nenvironmental change. With our Sales, Account Executives, Portfolio \nand Technology and Innovation teams we are working to:\n\n—  demystify sustainability and pinpoint the areas where both \nexisting and future technologies have a role to play in a more \nsustainable future; \n\n—  engage through the breadth of leadership programs to \ncreate sustainability-informed leaders within the Company; \nand\n\n—  continue to work with the key sectors in defining the \nsustainability impacts and opportunities to help our clients \nachieve their sustainability ambitions. Key sectors include: \nConsumer Products Retail Distribution, Manufacturing and \nEnergy, Utilities and Chemicals.\n\nWe have also run a series of “Sustainability Briefings” this year: \nvirtual webinars open to employees with an interest in sustainability, \ncovering topics including carbon accounting, net zero, lifecycle \ncarbon measurement and renewable energy.\n\nWe also have country-specific campaigns to educate, inform and \ninspire action. Altran Spain organized two key initiatives in 2020:\n\n—  a MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) designed to enhance \nawareness on sustainability actions including on waste, water, \npaper and energy management, transport and responsible \nconsumption. In 2020, 137\xa0Altran Spain employees took this \nvoluntary course; and\n\n—  an Environmental Annual Plan “Verde que te quiero verde” \nwas launched with a monthly communication providing key \ndata and information about tools, news and events each on \na particular environmental topic. Topics covered included \nwaste, energy, biodiversity, sustainable mobility, responsible \nconsumption and circular economy.\n\nCapgemini France launched a Sustainable IT campaign in 2020, \nsigning the Sustainable IT manifesto and participating in the \ncreation of a MOOC to raise awareness on Sustainable IT. This \ncampaign brought together an active community of experts \ndedicated to finding solutions to reduce the environmental impact \nof our IT projects. So far, 60% of employees in Capgemini France \nhave taken part in the awareness sessions around Sustainable IT. \nOther events were also organized throughout the year, including \nduring Environment Week, with sessions of The Climate Collage, \nDigital Clean Up sessions, bike repair workshops, conferences on \ncomposting and reforestation.\n\nAltran Portugal ran a series of environmental communications to \nengage and inspire employees into action, including around reducing \nplastic waste, increasing recycling and encouraging employees to \ncreate a digital signature to reduce the need for printing.\n\nEngage\n\nIn support of Group Environment Week, Capgemini’s global \nengagement campaign this year focused on “Lockdown Lessons \nfor a Better Planet.“ Key highlights included:\n\n—  Capgemini entities in 14\xa0 countries took part, with \n83,333\xa0employees viewing content; \n\n— 1 ,515\xa0 employees attended webinars and workshops on \nthe impact of Covid-19 on climate change, or a range of \ncountry-specific topics including zero waste, plastic pollution \nand biodiversity, introduction to composting, sustainable \nfood and shopping; and\n\n—  278\xa0employees from 18\xa0countries shared their own lockdown \nlessons for a better planet, with ideas on appreciating nature, \nrethinking waste, reducing use of resources like water and \nenergy, and transforming eating and shopping habits.\n\nThroughout the year, we joined with other companies to raise the \nbar on around climate action, including:\n\n—  we became a founder member of UN’s Race to Zero campaign \n– a coalition of leading net zero initiatives, representing \n452\xa0 cities, 22\xa0 regions, 1,101\xa0 businesses, 45\xa0 of the biggest \ninvestors and 549\xa0universities;\n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nCorporate, social, and environmental policies and results\n\n184 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n4.\n\n—  we signed the Business Ambition for 1.5\xa0degree targets; and\n\n—  we signed a joint letter along with over 170\xa0CEOs to European \nheads of state calling on them to increase emissions reduction \ntargets to ensure they reach their net zero target by 2050. \n\nWe also participate in and run public events, including a LinkedIn live \nevent in December focused on “how AI can Power Climate Action \nStrategy.” This brought together the strengths of the Capgemini \nResearch Institute, CSR & Invent teams plus industry experts \nto explore how to elevate artificial intelligence (AI), accelerate \nenterprise adoption and mobilization, to increase the positive \npotential of AI. 900\xa0people attended the event live with a further \n2,500\xa0viewing the video recording.\n\nOther examples of events and engagements in 2020 include:\n\n—  Capgemini reached 270\xa0 business and industry leaders \nthrough speaking engagements including at Imperial College \nLondon, Edie Sustainability Leader’s Forum, Edie Masterclass \nand at a Spotlight Series webinar on Circular Economy; \n\n—  Capgemini held a series of investor conferences and \none-on-one briefings, engaging 15\xa0 key investors on \nsustainability; \n\n—  Capgemini North America ran a webinar series as part of \nan Earth Day campaign, with 350\xa0 employees joining the \nwebinars and 170\xa0pledging to take personal actions; \n\n—  Capgemini Invent was a partner and keynote speaker at \nWorld Climate Forum Europe on November\xa0 17-18\xa0 during \nLondon Climate Action Week 2020; and\n\n—  Capgemini participated in 2020 AI for Good Global Summit \nof the UN’s ITU (International Telecommunications Union), \nwith a focus on how ethical AI can serve the citizen and help \nachieve the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nEmpower\n\nThrough hackathons and business challenges, we create a platform for \nour people to use their expertise and skills to address sustainability \nchallenges. Examples in 2020 included:\n\n—  working with leading marine biologist Lisa Steiner and \nAWS, Capgemini employees developed a new, self-learning \nAI solution to help protect sperm whales. The solution \neffectively identifies matches between images of sperm \n\nwhale tails in order to make it easier to draw a picture of \nmigration patterns.\n\n—  as part of the TeCh4Positive Futures challenge, 62\xa0 entries \ncame forward with innovative ideas for tackling \nenvironmental problems, including two shortlisted finalists: \na solution to combat the challenges of water scarcity and a \ntool to monitor the carbon footprint of email usage.\n\nThrough strategic partnerships with leading NGOs and industry \ngroups, Capgemini is supporting the acceleration of cross-industry \naction on sustainability.\n\n—  Capgemini became shareholder of EIT Innoenergy to \naccelerate the commercialization of sustainable energy \nstart-ups to help tackle climate change; \n\n—  Capgemini became a partner in the Equinor & Techstars \nEnergy Accelerator’ program, which supports Global \nInnovative Startups who have the vision to shape the future \nof energy; \n\n—  Capgemini signed up to TEDx Countdown, a global initiative \nto champion and accelerate solutions to the climate crisis, \nturning ideas into action over a year-long campaign; \n\n—  Capgemini Invent was commissioned by Breakthrough \nEnergy, a Bill Gates network, to publish the report Fit for \nNet Zero – 55\xa0Tech Questions on approaches to accelerating \nEurope’s recovery and paving the way to climate neutrality; \n\n—  Capgemini Italy entered into a collaboration with AWorld – a \nstartup selected by the UN to support its “ActNow” campaign \nfor individual action against climate change.

By \nDecember\xa0 10th, 2020, 237,866\xa0 trees had been planted and \n2,059\xa0people had signed up to support the initiative; \n\n—  Capgemini France signed Planet Tech’Care’s manifesto \nfurther strengthening its commitment to responsible digital \ntechnology, and; \n\n—  Capgemini UK partnered with Forum for The Future for its \nFuture of Sustainability 2020 Report.\n\n4.1.4  Employee engagement through volunteering\n\nOur employees are our greatest assets and their commitment to \nour CSR Program, Architects of Positive Futures, is key in driving and \nsustaining the impact of our CSR initiatives in local communities.\n\nIn 2020, with the creation of our Social Response Unit in the \ncontext of the Covid-19 pandemic, we have expanded upon our \nexisting social impact effort to purposefully apply our technology \nexpertise and passion where most needed in the fight against \nCovid-19. Capgemini colleagues have mobilized strongly, expressing \ntheir solidarity and leveraging their creative and deep technology \nand data expertise, to address the needs of local authorities and \ncommunities as they cope with the crisis.\n\nIn addition to the donation and delivery of hundreds of thousands \nof key pieces of personal protection and medical equipment to \nfrontline organizations such as hospitals, police departments and \nfire stations, a companywide internal ‘Call for Ideas’ saw more than \n250\xa0proposals from team members, in just two weeks, for short term \nand longer-term practical initiatives, on top of the 40\xa0pro-bono and \nvoluntary initiatives already underway. Capgemini’s Social Response \nUnit aims to accelerate, replicate and amplify welfare initiatives, \nenabling them to be executed in a coordinated manner with agility \nand speed, to deliver social impact to a broader set of individuals \nand communities. While the unit’s initial focus was solely on the \nneed of the hour – public health, a range of additional initiatives \nwere launched to address the next-order impacts of the pandemic \nand our colleagues across the globe came together leveraging \ntechnology, data and creative expertise to help and support the \ncommunities where we operate.\n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nCorporate, social, and environmental policies and results\n\nCAPGEMINI 185\n\n4.\n\nhere are some examples of the social impact delivered throu\nthe Social Response Unit initiative:\n\ngh \n\n—  in France, Capgemini helped build several key functionalities \nfor the COVIDOM platform supporting French public \nhospitals (APhP) and doctors and medical practitioners \nvolunteering to help during the Covid-19 crisis; we also \nhelped deliver a platform enabling doctors to communicate \nwith their patients at home and we co-delivered Globule, \na plateform which enables cross-functional healthcare \nproviders to collaborate and ensure seamless, continuous \ncare; \n\n—  in India, Capgemini developed, with the Indian Institute of \nTechnology (IIT) Madras, affordable, field deployable, rapid \ntest kits for COVID19, with a view to the entire test result \nbeing available in 10\xa0minutes at a significantly lower cost;\n\n—  in Italy, Capgemini is supporting Fondazione Banco \nAlimentare ONLUS which coordinates the Banco Alimentare \nNetwork and is managing recovery and distribution of food \nto people and families in dificulty through the National \nBanco Alimentare’s Municipal Operations Centers; \n\n—  in the Netherlands, Capgemini contributed advice and \ntechnical expertise to the cybersecurity coalition Wij helpen \nZiekenhuizen (“We help hospitals”), to ensure the continuity \nof the health sector and its care provision during these \nchallenging times; \n\n—  in Norway, Capgemini supported three municipalities by \nsetting up a webpage for local businesses to upload their \nprofiles to promote their offerings to communities in Oslo, \nBergen, and Stavanger; \n\n—  in France, we opened our Group University for 2\xa0months to \nhost victims of domestic violence through the first full lock \ndown;\n\n—  across Europe, experts have also created a’Telehealth \nToolbox’ website to help doctors accelerate the transition to \ntelemedicine during the pandemic.\n\nIt is clear that Capgemini people are passionate about making \nthe world a better place. To illustrate the extent to which they \nmobilized themselves, especially during the first half of 2020 \nas the pandemic put billions of people in distress, we had over \n3 times the number of employees engaged in volunteering in \nH1 2020 than we did in H1 2019.\n\nAmong the many initiatives to which our employees gave their time \nand created impact as Architects of Positive Futures this year are:\n\ni.  In North America, the annual Cares Day of Service was \norganized for the 8th\xa0year in a row. All volunteer events were \nvirtual due to the Covid-19 crisis. Despite this challenge, 11% \nof employees were able to participate, a 28% increase in \nparticipation compared to 2019. \n\nii.  In India, CSR initiatives were held virtually throughout the \nyear, drawing thousands of employees to activities across our \n3\xa0CSR pillars. This year, India also joined the Impact Together \nWeek (a global volunteering week organized annually by our \nFinancial Services Social Business Unit since 2017) where \nemployees were engaged largely around Digital Inclusion, \namong other social impact initiatives. \n\niii.  In Germany, many of our Annual Volunteer Day initiatives \nwere transformed into virtual events running between \nSeptember and October. More than 250\xa0 colleagues \nvolunteered in various CSR projects directly reaching out to \nabout 650\xa0beneficiaries.\n\niv.  Our cloud infrastructure services (CIS) Global Business Line \ncreated specific initiatives under its Digital Futures Program \nto mobilize employees globally. This leveraged their skills to \nhelp people within their personal ecosystems (communities, \nneighborhoods, families,\xa0 etc.) learn digital skills. In the \ncontext of the pandemic, this movement gathered huge \nmomentum from our CIS colleagues across the Group, \ncontributing thousands of hours to support the excluded.\n\nv.  We held our FS Impact Together Week for the 4th\xa0year in a row, \nwith over 90\xa0 volunteer opportunities being organized for \nFinancial Services colleagues across 13\xa0countries. The week \nmobilized more than 5,500\xa0 employees in diverse initiatives \naround our 3\xa0CSR pillars and in other social impact initiatives.\n\nThese are just a small handful of examples that demonstrate the \ncommitment of our people to create positive impact in society and \nthe environment. Despite the whole company being in lockdown \nat different points of time throughout the year, the spirit of \nsolidarity and passion for helping people was very much alive \nand our colleagues went above and beyond to make a difference.\n\nThis increase in engagement through volunteering was also facilitated \nby the deployment of the 4PositiveFutures volunteering platform \ndesigned to make engagement opportunities more accessible. \nWe had started its deployment in 2019 and at the end of 2020 we \nhave been able to extend the platform to over 80% of our global \nheadcount (excluding Altran). We will continue expanding it to \nother countries in 2021 to ensure maximum coverage. This will \nenable employees from all over Capgemini to explore volunteering \nopportunities, engage and become Architects of Positive Futures.\n\nIn 2021, we will also join hands with our new colleagues from Altran \nto engage more people in volunteering and amplify the impact we \ncreate in society and on the environment.\n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nEthics & Compliance\n\n186 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n4.\n\n4.2  Ethics & Compliance\n\nWith our values at their core, our Ethics and Compliance programs \nare crucial for the success of a diverse, decentralized Group like \nours, with multicultural teams operating in nearly 50\xa0countries. \nOur ethics program upholds our ethical culture, which is also the \nfoundation for our compliance program.\n\nThe Group is strongly committed to acting in line with its ethical \nstandards and in full compliance with laws, as set out below.\n\nFor more details on our ethics and compliance programs governance, \nplease refer to Section\xa03.1.3.\n\n4.2.1  Values and Ethics\n\nOur values and Ethics are at the heart of our identity. Unique and \nhuman, our values set us apart from competitors and inspire and \nguide our team members, who each contribute to our ethical culture.\n\nThey are the precious assets on which our reputation as an ethical \nand responsible company is founded. Capgemini is proud to have \nbeen recognized one of the “World’s Most Ethical Companies®” \nfor 9\xa0consecutive years by the Ethisphere Institute, and to be one \nof only 2\xa0honorees in our industry, a strong commendation of our \nethical business practices.\n\nCapgemini’s founder, Serge Kampf, was deeply convinced that \nsound ethics is the foundation of a profitable and sustainable \nbusiness. From the outset, our belief in doing business ethically and \nour commitment to our 7\xa0core values has differentiated us from \ncompetitors. While our teams are located worldwide, we share \na common culture based on honesty, trust, and respect for each \nother’s backgrounds and contributions to our joint enterprise. Being \na values-based organization has enabled us to develop extremely \nhigh ethical standards while nurturing the diversity of our teams. \nIt has also guided our behavior throughout the many evolutions \nour Group has seen, whilst allowing us the freedom needed to \nadapt to our fast-moving industry, and the boldness we need to \nlead. Our ethical cultural framework supports our team members \nin doing the right thing, adhering to our principles and rules, and \nmaking the right decisions. It also promotes agile behaviors well \nfitted to unanticipated events that can arise in complex situations. \nThis ethical framework connects all our Group’s employees, in \nnearly 50\xa0countries.\n\nPolicies and Actions\n\nWe have a longstanding formal Ethics program, to actively nurture \nour ethical culture. Our program aims to create and maintain \nawareness among employees, enabling them to make decisions \naligned with our core values. It is supported by 5\xa0main levers:\n\nOur Policies: first of all, our Code of Business Ethics provides \nguidance to all team members on how to behave and act in the \nright way, so no one is left with doubt or unanswered questions. \nIt is available in multiple languages, to all our employees.\n\nAdditional detail is set out in our Group policies for our ethics \nhelpline SpeakUP (including non-retaliation) and the prevention \nof conflicts of interest, supplemented by policies adopted under \nour Compliance program. Since the Group was founded, we have \nalways believed that a profitable and sustainable business cannot \nexist without sound ethics. This belief lies at the very heart of our \ndecentralized organization, which empowers our team members, \nunited by our shared values. Our Code of Business Ethics is our \nongoing commitment to maintaining and promoting a world-class \nframework to support business integrity and trust wherever we \noperate. This commitment to the code is endorsed by all members \nof the Board of Directors of Capgemini and members of the Group \nExecutive Board (GEB) as part of their individual and collective \nsupport of the provisions of the Code of Business Ethics.\n\nCapgemini has paid particular attention to artificial intelligence \n(AI) as a key growth area, presenting both huge opportunities and \na challenge to build trust, by devising our “Code of Ethics for AI’”: \nan ethical framework for the development of all AI solutions within \nthe Group. Our vision of AI is determined by our ethical culture and \nguided by our core values; we thus envisage our developments in \nAI as a contribution to building the inclusive and sustainable future \nwe all aim for. Our Code of Ethics for AI sets out guidelines for \nthe ethical and human-centric design and delivery of AI solutions.\n\nOur ethics helpline, SpeakUP is a natural extension of our \nvalues-based culture and high ethical standards. It is a web and \nphone-based ethics reporting, incident management and advisory \ntool, hosted by an independent service provider, managed by Group \nEthics and supported by our global network of Ethics & Compliance \nOficers and hR investigators. SpeakUP is voluntary, confidential, \nand allows anonymity, except in countries where anonymity would \nnot comply with local laws. It is made available by Capgemini to \nour team members, customers, suppliers, and business partners. \nSpeakUP is a commitment from Capgemini: to listen to voices when \nraised in good faith; to be fair when investigating an alert, to respect \norganizational justice and maintain confidentiality; and to protect \nthe reporter from any form of retaliation. SpeakUP empowers people \nto report alerts and/or ask for advice and guidance about actions \nor behaviors that are (1) not aligned with our values, our Code of \nBusiness Ethics and related Ethics & Compliance policies, (2) not \nin compliance with applicable laws, or (3) that may significantly \naffect vital interests of Capgemini and its afiliates.\n\nAnyone who raises or helps to address an alert on SpeakUP in good \nfaith is protected by our non-retaliation policy, and substantiated \nalerts result in appropriate remediation actions including disciplinary \nactions, counselling/training, or process improvements. Our \nSpeakUP policy and helpline are available in multiple languages and \nthe SpeakUP helpline is available 24X7. Once an alert is reported in \nSpeakUP, it is received by the Group Ethics Ofice, which performs \nan initial review. After this initial assessment, the Group Ethics \nOfice assigns the alert to the local Ethics & Compliance Oficer \nresponsible for the jurisdiction where the incident reported in \nthe alert occurred. An exception to this process would happen in \ncases where there is an actual, potential, or perceived conflict of \ninterest for the local Ethics & Compliance Oficer to investigate \nthe alert, or where the Group Ethics Ofice believes that the alert \nis of such a severe nature it must be investigated at Group level.\n\nSpeakUP helps us maintain transparency by managing the entire \nprocess within the tool, including communication with the reporters, \ninvestigation team, witnesses, leadership teams,\xa0etc., and record \nretention and redaction as per the applicable laws. It helps us \nperform root-cause analysis and prevent future similar unethical \nbehavior, misconduct, violation of policies or applicable laws, by \nhelping us identify areas of improvement in our business processes.\n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nEthics & Compliance\n\nCAPGEMINI 187\n\n4.\n\nActing on the feedback received from our annual ethical culture \nsurvey, we share SpeakUP statistics with our employees globally \nthrough our annual ethics newsletter “Ethics Buzz”. We also share \nsanitized SpeakUP cases through our communication initiative \n“Ethics Radio” on an ongoing basis to further enhance trust and \nreinforce our ethical culture.\n\nSpeakUP has been deployed in all countries where the Group, \noperates, except for Germany and Morocco, where the deployment \nis in process: in the meantime, these countries continue to use \nthe legacy mechanism, i.e. “Raising Concerns Procedure”, while \nwe work closely with local data protection authorities and works \ncouncils to complete the roll-out. SpeakUP has also been recently \nextended to Altran.\n\nOur Ethical Culture survey, in which all our employees are invited \nto participate and share their views annually, measures the pulse \nof our organizational ethical culture. In 2020, the Group Ethics \nteam conducted the annual ethical culture survey using a pulse \ntype of survey on a platform hosted by an external provider. \nClose to 75,000\xa0employees from 42\xa0countries participated with \na voluntary response rate of 1 in every 3\xa0team members. The \nsurvey had questions on our ethical culture, policies, behaviors, \nand SpeakUP. It confirmed a widespread perception among team \nmembers that Capgemini is an ethical workplace, and a very strong \nlevel of awareness of Capgemini’s Code of Business Ethics (score \nof 8.3\xa0out of 10), and effectiveness of our ethics program through \ncommunication and training (score of 8.2\xa0out of 10). Aggregated \nfeedback and analysis from the survey, along with guidelines, were \nshared with team managers, and business and country leaders. \nAll managers have access to their span’s dashboard, with scores \nand feedback, while maintaining anonymity of employees. The \ninsights from the survey results have been taken into account for \nthe Ethics program planning for 2021, with focus on improving \nvalues & ethics discussions within team meetings, and further \nenhancing our speaking up culture through ethical leadership \ntraining. They have also been considered to revamp the monthly \nnewsletter “Think Ethics” and incorporate an easy-to-use toolkit \nfor team managers to engage with their team members about \nvalues and ethical topics.\n\nOur training program includes:\n\n—  mandatory e-learning courses on Our Code of Business Ethics \n– Ethics@Capgemini was revamped in 2020, with a refreshed \nlearner interface and modular format, and will be assigned \nannually to all employees starting 2021, with test-out options \nfor subsequent years; Ethics@Capgemini comprises a core \nmodule and scenario-based micro e-learnings on ethics \ntopics, featuring short engaging videos on how to handle \ntricky ethical situations;\n\n—  Think Ethics, a managers’ toolkit shared monthly with team \nmanagers, and Ethics Café, featuring short thought-provoking \nawareness videos on a range of workplace-related ethical \nsituations shared with our team members;\n\n—  investigations refresher-training for our Ethics & Compliance \nOficers and hR investigators, conducted by external \nexperienced investigators.\n\nOur ethics awareness communication program, built globally \nat Group level and deployed locally in each country, addresses \nall employees, with communication targeted by grade and role. \nThe program uses multiple internal channels to communicate \nthrough: recurring events such as the Ethics Week and values \nDay; and various other means such as real-case podcasts, videos, \narticles, quizzes and posts on Yammer (our internal social network). \nGroup and local communication networks, along with our Ethics \n& Compliance Oficers network, promote ethics communications \nglobally and locally on our values and ethics.\n\nWe focus on continuous improvement of the program through \nexternal benchmark assessments conducted by a leading provider \nof independent research on workplace integrity, ethical standards, \nand compliance processes and practices in public and private \ninstitutions. As part of our continuous improvement efforts, our \nCode of Business Ethics policy was reviewed by an external ethics \nadvisory organization and we have membership with global ethics \norganizations to stay updated and adapt to important changes.\n\nIn addition, in 2021, the full ethics program and its related processes \nwill be audited by an external firm.\n\nResults and Key Performance Indicators (KPI)\n\n KPI Scope 2018 2019 2020 \n2021 \n\nTarget\n\nSpeakUP coverage SpeakUP coverage (1)  C 82% 97% 98% 100%\n\nTotal alerts reported on \nSpeakUP (2)  \n\nAlerts reported on SpeakUP C N/A (3)  ~215 ~279 N/A\n\nAnonymous alerts Share of the total alerts reported on SpeakUP C N/A 59% 44% N/A\n\nSubstantiated alerts Share of the closed alerts and those  \nestablished/proven\n\nC N/A 46% 47% N/A\n\nCode of Business Ethics \ne‑learning\n\nShare of employees who completed the  \ne-learning module on the Code of Business Ethics\n\nC 94% 95% 96% 96% (4)  \n\nScope: (C) stands for Capgemini legacy, (A) stands for Altran legacy and (C+A) for Capgemini and Altran.\n(1) Calculated as a percentage of total headcount at December\xa031st.\n(2) For alerts that are out of scope of the SpeakUP policy, the reporters are guided to use the appropriate mechanism or reach out to the relevant function for review, and the \n\nalerts are subsequently deleted from SpeakUP. The KPI shows only the in-scope alerts. Our employees also reach out to their team managers or hR managers for reporting \nalerts, therefore the total number of alerts received in 2020 would be higher. We are in the process of converging local reporting channels into SpeakUP ; team managers \nand hR managers are expected to record alerts reported to them by their team members on SpeakUP.\n\n(3) Since SpeakUP roll-out was in progress in 2018, the alerts were managed through our legacy system Raising Concerns Procedure.\n(4) A revamped Code of Business Ethics e-learning will be launched in 2021.\n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nEthics & Compliance\n\n188 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n4.\n\nAs an outcome of SpeakUP investigations, the substantiated alerts \nresulted in appropriate remediation such as a review and update \nof processes, counselling/training, or disciplinary actions for \nindividuals, based on the severity of the alerts.\n\nIn 2020, the countries of origin of the alerts were: Australia, \nBrazil, Canada, Finland, France, Guatemala, India, Italy, Japan, \n\nMalaysia, Mexico, Poland, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, \nthe Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States. In \naddition to the alerts, we received 94\xa0enquiries seeking guidance \nfrom employees: all these questions were promptly addressed by \nour Ethics & Compliance Oficers.\n\n4.2.2 Compliance \n\nOur Compliance program covers mainly: (1) the fight against corruption \nand money laundering, duty of care and human rights, which are \nunder the responsibility of the Chief Compliance Oficer, and (2) \ncompetition, sanctions and embargos as well as data protection, \nwhich are under the responsibility of the Group General Counsel.\n\nOur policies and actions relating to Duty of Care and human Rights \nare set out in Section\xa04.3.2.\n\nOur anti-corruption, data protection and competition programs \nare described below.\n\n4.2.2.1  Anti-corruption\n\nAs part of its Ethics & Compliance Programs, the \nGroup adopted its Group Anti-Corruption Policy \nand an anti-corruption training formalizing our zero \ntolerance for corruption.\n\nWe recognize the fight against corruption as part of \nCapgemini’s commitment to society (SDG Goal 16), reflected in \nthe tenth principle of the UN Global Compact, which Capgemini \nfirst signed in 2004.\n\nThe adoption of the “Sapin II” law in France has strengthened the \nframework of the fight against corruption and raised the standards. \nWe are committed to continually improving our anti-corruption \ncompliance program, which covers all our consolidated afiliates \nworld-wide. In 2020 Capgemini has further implemented its \nanti-corruption compliance program as follows across the 8\xa0measures \nand procedures identified in the French “Sapin II” law:\n\n1. A major focus in 2020 was the updating of the Altran \nanti-corruption risk map, following its acquisition by the \nGroup in April\xa02020. In 2019, Capgemini completed a revised \nGroup anti-corruption risk map that was extended to \n34\xa0countries.\n\n2. Our Group Anti-Corruption Policy, publicly available since \n2018, was further revised in 2020 to include scenarios that \nreflect the 2019 Capgemini group and 2020 Altran Group \nanti-corruption risk maps. It integrates tightened controls \nor examples on hospitality, meals, invitations to both \nprivate persons and public oficials; rules around charitable \ndonations, sponsoring and lobbying. The Group Anti-\n\nCorruption Policy also reiterates our long-standing rule that \nstrictly prohibits contributions to political organizations.\n\n3. Our SpeakUP helpline is available across the Group and has \nbeen extended to Altran, ensuring the effectiveness of our \nreporting system. (see Section\xa04.2.1 for more information on \nSpeakUP).\n\n4. Capgemini has leveraged our Procurement and Sales \nmanagement systems to categorize all clients and first-tier \nsuppliers according to country and activity sector risk \nusing a common methodology. We have developed specific \nprocedures to validate requests for identified high risk \ntransactions. Altran third parties have also been categorized \nand will be integrated into Capgemini due diligence \nprocesses in 2021.\n\n5. Accounting controls to detect and prevent corruption were \nformalized in the TransFORM manual in 2020, which sets out \nprocedures that all financial staff are required to apply.\n\n6. The mandatory e-learning for all employees on corruption \nrisks was updated to integrate the revisions to the Group \nAnti-Corruption Policy and a pilot webinar training was \ndeveloped for most exposed employees by function. In \naddition, Altran has its own anti-corruption e-learning, which \nis mandatory for certain at-risk employees (mainly sales, \npurchasing and support/management functions).\n\n7. We ensured the integration of the Group Anti-Corruption \nPolicy into the internal regulations (règlement intérieur) in \nFrance and other countries, where applicable, and completed \na Group-level review of country labor law requirements to be \nable to enforce disciplinary measures, where appropriate, for \nviolations of the Group Anti-Corruption Policy.\n\n8. The review of the effectiveness of controls aimed at verifying \nthe proper implementation of the Group’s anti-corruption \nprogram is systematically carried out by the Group’s internal \naudit department during audits carried out as part of the \nannual audit plan.\n\nOur anti-corruption compliance program has been presented to the \nInternational Workers Committee and to the Ethics & Governance \nCommittee of the Board of Directors at least annually since 2018.\n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nEthics & Compliance\n\nCAPGEMINI 189\n\n4.\n\nPolicies and Actions\n\nResults and Key Performance Indicators (KPI)\n\nCapgemini KPI Scope 2018 2019 2020 \n\nAnti-corruption policy \ne-learning (Capgemini)\n\nShare of employees who completed the e-learning \nmodule on Anti-corruption Policy\n\nC 94% 96% 96% \n\nAltran KPIs Scope 2018 2019 2020 \n\nAnti-corruption e-learning – \nAltran Europe\n\nShare of targeted employees who completed the \ne-learning module on anti-corruption policy A N/A 37.30% (1)  85.80% \n\nAnti-corruption e-learning – \nAltran North America & India\n\nShare of targeted employees who completed the \ne-learning module on anti-corruption policy\n\nA N/A N/A 97% (2)  \n\nScope: (C) stands for Capgemini legacy, (A) stands for Altran legacy and (C+A) for Capgemini and Altran.\n(1) E-learning was launched in 2\xa0waves in May and September\xa02019.\n(2) E-learning launched in 2020.\n\n4.2.2.2  Data Protection \n\nIn an economic environment where the volume and value of data \nhas exploded, the protection of the data we process both on our \nown and clients’ behalf is key for Capgemini’s strategy. This is \ntrue for our existing offers and becomes even more important as \nCapgemini defines every day new data driven business models.\n\nSince May\xa02018, the General Data Protection Regulation (known \nas “the GDPR”) has changed data protection from a tick the \nbox approach into an accountability approach. This means that \ncompanies have to document their Data Protection program to \nbe able to demonstrate how they comply with applicable laws \nvis-à-vis data protection authorities and clients. Although data \nprotection and cybersecurity has long been known to be an EU \ncentric concern, several non-EU countries have adopted or are \ncurrently adopting data protection legislations. For instance, Brazil \nadopted Data Protection legislation, which became effective in \nSeptember\xa02020, California adopted the Consumer Privacy Act, \nand India is expected to adopt data protection legislation in the \ncoming months. Interestingly, many of the laws adopted outside of \nthe EU are based on the GDPR standards, which makes it even more \nurgent for companies to have a global approach on data protection.\n\nIn this context, companies must pay attention to compliance with \napplicable legislations to manage the risk of being fined by data \nprotection authorities and to reduce the impact (e.g. on operations \nor reputation) of a data breach.\n\nAs a key player in the engineering and IT services domain, with \nmore than 270,000\xa0employees altogether, Capgemini and Altran \nmust ensure compliance with these laws both when processing \npersonal data on its behalf (its employees’ data in particular) \nbut also when processing data on behalf of its clients. Both \ndimensions are essential. Indeed, clients expect for their service \nproviders like Capgemini and Altran to be able to demonstrate \ntheir accountability upfront.\n\nIn this context, Capgemini and Altran constantly enhance their \nglobal approach to adapt to the new legal requirements as well \nas to the changing environment.\n\nData protection organization\n\nBoth at Capgemini and at Altran, the Group Data Protection Oficers \n(“GDPO”) define and implement the Data Protection Program.\n\nAt Capgemini, the GDPO relies on Regional Data Protection \nOficers and Local Data Protection Oficers to ensure that the \nglobal strategy is implemented throughout the organization. In \n\naddition, Data Protection Champions are appointed to represent \neach Group function and Global Business Line (GBL) to ensure \nthat not only the Group governance is implemented, but also \nthat functions and GBL specificities are taken into account in the \nroll-out of the Group Program.\n\nAt Altran, the GDPO relies on Local Data Protection Officers \nappointed at local level. Business process owners, acting as data \ncontrollers for internal processing activities, are supported by a \nnetwork of business process analysts in charge of improving and \nsecuring internal processes and tools. They are responsible for \nimplementing organizational and technical measures to protect \npersonal data, to mitigate the risks and to implement retention \nperiods in their respective applications.\n\nCapgemini group Data Protection Policy and \nassociated guidelines\n\nBack in 2016, Capgemini adopted Binding Corporate Rules (“BCR”) \napproved by the European Data Protection Authorities. The BCR \nconstitute Capgemini core Data Protection Policy defining the \ndifferent principles Capgemini has to comply with and to implement \nwhen processing personal data on its behalf and on behalf of its \nclients. In January\xa02019, Capgemini submitted a new version of its \nBCR to the French Data Protection Authority, in order to comply \nwith the new requirements imposed by GDPR.\n\nCapgemini monitors the effective implementation of the BCR \nthrough different procedures and controls such as:\n\n—  data subjects’ rights management; \n—  data transfers;\n—  Data Protection Authorities dawn raid procedure; \n—  data breach management procedure; \n—  data protection training program.\n\n  \n\nIn addition, specific actions for each Group function have been \nimplemented:\n\nSales and Delivery: we put emphasis on providing the relevant \ntoolkits to the employees to be able to translate our data protection \nobligations into each engagement. The Data Protection Booklet \nfor Sales contains, among others, a methodology for assessing \nthe data protection risk at the bidding phase, request for proposal \n(RFP) standard answers, a Privacy by Design Checklist and the key \ntalking points about our Binding Corporate Rules. As far as Delivery \nis concerned, a Data Protection Maturity Assessment provides the \nEngagement Managers with a checklist for risk control purposes \nand maturity assessment.\n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nEthics & Compliance\n\n190 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n4.\n\nHuman Resources: we have mapped the hR applications as part of \nour obligation to keep a data processing register up to date. This \nexercise is carried out through our tool called Nymity and enables \nus to assess the compliance of the different processing activities \nwe carry out on our hR applications and to ensure they take data \nprotection by default into account.\n\nProcurement: we ensure that our ecosystem of suppliers provides \nan adequate level of protection to the personal data they process \non our behalf based on data protection due diligence questionnaire.\n\nIT and Cybersecurity: we are working closely with the IT and \nCybersecurity teams to ensure that we have a data breach and \nsecurity incident management policy, as well as relevant tools to \nensure effective implementation of data protection obligations. \nWe are also working together to continue raising awareness on \ndata and cybersecurity matters worldwide.\n\nSeveral controls are in place and audits are carried out in order \nto monitor Capgemini’s compliance with the above-mentioned \nPolicies, procedures and guidelines.\n\nCapgemini also monitors the potential requests it may receive \nfrom public authorities to communicate data. In 2020, according \nto the record of the Group Legal team, Capgemini has not received \nrequests from any public authority to communicate data processed \nby Capgemini either on its own behalf or on behalf of its clients.\n\nAltran Group Data Protection Policy and associated \nguidelines\n\nAltran has a Data Protection Policy which defines the principles \nwhich shall govern processing activities of Altran when both acting \nas controller and processor. Furthermore, several Notices have been \n\nadopted: ‘Privacy Notice Employees’ which informs employees \nregarding their rights and duties, ‘Privacy Notice for Candidates’ \nwhich explains to the candidates the processing of their personal \ndata during the recruitment process, and ‘Website Privacy Notice’ \nfor Altran website visitors. The Policy and the notices have been \nupdated in 2020.\n\nFurthermore, Altran ensures that Privacy is considered from the \ndesign phase of its projects both when acting as data controller and \nas data processor. This is tracked into SYNERGI, Altran Global Risk \n& Compliance tool, which also allows to structure and monitor the \nrecords of processing activities, the risks and the internal control \nin the most standardized way. The global dashboard shows at the \nend of 2020, an overall compliance rate at 86% (compared to 77% \nend of 2019 and 42% when first estimated).\n\nFor the first time, in 2020 an in-depth audit of Altran Data Protection \nProgram was carried out by a specialized external firm. The detailed \nreport shows that the program has a solid foundation and identifies \nsome areas for improvement, which have been taken into account.\n\nAs planned, in 2020 supplier audits were launched following \nthe definition of an internal process involving data protection, \npurchasing and cybersecurity departments and based on a detailed \nquestionnaire regarding the protection of outsourced data.\n\nImportance of awareness for both Capgemini and Altran\n\nTo ensure an effective implementation of these respective \nprograms, both Altran and Capgemini have implemented awareness \nprograms relying, in particular on a general mandatory training for \nall employees, which is supplemented by specific training targeting \nthe functions’ particular needs.\n\nPolicies and Actions\n\nResults and Key Performance Indicators (KPI)\n\nCapgemini KPIs Scope 2018 2019 2020 \n\nGeneral training on data \nprotection\n\nPercentage of employees attending the data  \nprotection training\n\nC 76% 88% 92% \n\nData subjects’ rights  \nrequests\n\nNumber of requests of data subjects exercising  \none of the rights granted under GDPR\n\nC N/A N/A 102 \n\nData breaches notified to  \nData Protection Authorities\n\nNumber of data breaches notified as data controller  \nto competent Data Protection Authorities\n\nC N/A N/A 5 \n\nScope: (C) stands for Capgemini legacy, (A) stands for Altran legacy and (C+A) for Capgemini and Altran.\n\nAltran KPIs Scope 2018 2019 2020 \n\n2020 Training:  \ndata protection\n\nPercentage of employees attending the data  \nprotection training\n\nA 47% 72% 86% \n\nData subjects’  \nrights requests\n\nNumber of requests of employees exercising  \ntheir right of access granted under GDPR\n\nA 18 24 20 \n\nScope: (C) stands for Capgemini legacy, (A) stands for Altran legacy and (C+A) for Capgemini and Altran.\n\n4.2.2.3  Competition\n\nOur Competition laws policy sets out the Groups’ commitment to \ncomplying with all applicable competition laws and regulations.\n\nThe Policy focuses on one of the standards set out in our Code of \nBusiness Ethics: “Fair Competition”. Its purpose is to help Group \n\nemployees worldwide identify and avoid situations that could \nviolate competition laws.\n\nThe Group has also developed a mandatory e-learning training on \nits Competition Laws Policy to ensure employees become familiar \nwith the rules described in this Policy.\n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nEthics & Compliance\n\nCAPGEMINI 191\n\n4.\n\nPolicies and Actions\n\nResults and Key Performance Indicators (KPI)\n\n KPI Scope 2018 2019 2020 \n\nCompetition laws policy \ne-learning (Capgemini)\n\nShare of employees that completed the e-learning  \nmodule on competition laws policy\n\nC 90% 90% 94% \n\nScope: (C) stands for Capgemini legacy, (A) stands for Altran legacy and (C+A) for Capgemini and Altran.\n\n4.2.3  Group Tax Policy\n\nAs a global leader in consulting, technology services and digital \ntransformation, we have ofices in nearly 50\xa0countries and operate \nin a sector in constant evolution.\n\nDue to the international nature of its activities, the complexity and \nthe absence of clarity of certain specific national or international \ntax regulations, the Group is exposed to tax risks. We strive to \nconsider all existing factors in this environment in order to make \nthe right tax decisions, even when there is uncertainty.\n\nWe operate within well established and publicly advocated core \nvalues, such as honesty and trust, and a robust internal Code of \nEthics, and we are internationally recognized in this regard (see \nSection\xa04.2.1 for additional information).\n\nThe Group’s commitment to ethical behavior is directly reflected in \nits management of fiscal affairs through the following measures:\n\n1.  Capgemini does not engage in tax evasion nor in any practice \nthat goes against the Group’s Code of Ethics and ethical \nvalues; \n\n2.  the Group implements a coherent, consistent and reasonable \napproach to its tax responsibilities, suited for its activities; \n\n3.  Capgemini does not practice aggressive tax planning nor \nstructure transactions with a view to tax evasion, nor in a \nmanner likely to harm its operating activities. The Group \nrecognizes its revenue and pays its taxes in the countries \nwhere it is located, thus reflecting the actual value generated \nby its activities. It undertakes to apply arm’s length prices \nin its internal cross-border transactions, in accordance \nwith internationally recognized principles. Capgemini \ndoes not create nor use opaque or artificial structures and \nconstantly revises its legal structure to ensure it is suited \nto its operational needs; if, in the context of an acquisition, \nCapgemini inherits such entities, it is committed to either \neliminating them or aligning their tax policy to Capgemini’s \nas soon as possible;\n\n4.  the Group’s tax planning is thus limited to enjoying existing \ntax measures and tax relief, after honest and objective \nanalysis, and in accordance with the law; \n\n5.  these principles also apply to relationships with the tax \nauthorities. Capgemini maintains a cooperative, open \nand courteous relationship with them, in every country. \nCapgemini’s tax situation and tax practices are regularly \naudited. Capgemini undertakes to respond within the given \ntime limits to all requests from the tax authorities, to comply \nwith all filing and reporting requirements and to pay its taxes \non time; \n\n6.  given the complexity of the fiscal context in which Capgemini \noperates, an internal Tax function monitors regulatory \ndevelopments, and provides the Group’s companies with \nthe appropriate advice and education. This function is \ncomposed of a network of tax experts based in our main \nregions, which make their counterparts aware of tax issues \nand promote good governance. Regular interaction with \nstakeholders, combined with the appropriate involvement of \nthe Tax teams, ensures that potential risks are identified in a \ntimely manner, and that appropriate mitigation measures are \nimplemented where appropriate. This Tax function regularly \nassesses its resources to ensure that they are consistent with \nthe needs of the Group; \n\n7.  Capgemini recognizes that the use of external tax advisors, \nwhich are chosen by the Group according to their qualifications \nand their reputation, adds value, particularly when they \nprovide advice on new legislation and the interpretation of \ncase law. All advice thus received is reviewed internally to \nensure that any resulting action complies with the Group’s \ntax principles.\n\nThe principles mentioned above apply to all entities which are part \nof the Group, in every country and to all taxes due.\n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nDuty of care\n\n192 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n4.\n\n4.3  Duty of care\n\nSince 2017, further to the statute no. 2017-399\xa0covering the duty of \ncare (devoir de vigilance) of parent companies and purchasers, it is \nmandatory for French companies with more than 5,000\xa0employees \nto develop and implement a reasonable plan (plan de vigilance) to \nidentify risks and prevent serious violations with regard to human \nrights and fundamental freedoms, people’s health and Safety and \nthe environment, resulting from its own activities and those of \ntheir subsidiaries, subcontractors and suppliers.\n\nMeeting our duty of care obligations is a long-term commitment \nsubject to continuous improvement. Accordingly, in 2021 we plan \nto build on our approach and our achievements described below \n\nto improve our performance, including the integration of Altran \ninto our program.\n\nThis Section presents a summary of Capgemini’s plan with respect \nto its duty of care and its implementation in the following areas: \nresponsible procurement, human rights, people’s health and \nSafety and the environment. The topics covered by the statement \non non-financial performance, namely people’s health and Safety \n(Section\xa04.1.1.6) and the environment (Section\xa04.1.3) are set out \nin detail in the corresponding Sections. As a prerequisite, these \ntopics are methodologically aligned with the Group’s risk mapping \nand materiality assessment (Section\xa03.2.2).\n\n4.3.1  Our approach: Risk Mapping\n\nIn 2020, the Group proceeded with a specific risk mapping exercise \ncovering Corporate Social Responsibility risks including with respect \nto the Group’s duty of care. This mapping was conducted with \nthe assistance of external consultants and engaged the Group’s \ninternal stakeholders in order to ensure a fair and rigorous rating \nof each of the issues, using a uniform methodology. In order to \ndraw up and validate this risk mapping, several interviews were \n\nconducted with all the relevant functions. A representative sample \nof internal stakeholders enabled an eficient and exhaustive risk \nmap to be drawn up. For more details on the methodology used, \nplease refer to Section\xa04.4.\n\nThis updated risk mapping exercise identified serious risks relating \nto the Group’s duty of care in the following areas concerning the \nGroup (including its subsidiaries) and/or its supply chain:\n\nGroup and its subsidiaries Supply Chain\n\nHuman Rights\n\nNon-implementation of the Code of Business Ethics for  \nall the Group companies and employees\n\nNon-compliance with the Supplier Standards of Conduct\n\nInsuficient awareness and training on ethical issues Non-compliance with local labor laws\n\nFailure to apply sanctions in the event of non-compliance  \nwith the Code of Business Ethics\n\nNon-compliance with international labor standards\n\nInsuficient internal communication, deployment and \naccessibility of the ethical concerns reporting system\n\nInsuficient external communication (for suppliers), deployment \nand accessibility of the ethical concerns reporting system\n\nPeople’s Health & Safety\n\nPsychological and sexual harassment within the Group Non-compliance with the Supplier Standards of Conduct\n\nIsolation at work Non-compliance with local labor laws\n\nBreach of right to disconnection Non-compliance with international labor standards\n\nPolitical violence in a country at risk Insuficient external communication (for suppliers), deployment \nand accessibility of the ethical concerns reporting system\n\nEnvironment\n\nNon respect of carbon emission reduction targets\n\nDrift in energy consumption and increase in environmental \nimpacts\n\nNon respect by a main supplier of carbon emission reduction \ntargets\n\nRisk of natural disaster in a country where the Group is located\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nDuty of care\n\nCAPGEMINI 193\n\n4.\n\n \n\n4.3.2.1  Assessment Procedures \n\nInternal Assessments\n\nOur internal audit team proceeds with regular audits of our \nvarious subsidiaries as regards ethical matters and reports on such \nmatters to the Ethics and Governance Committee of the Board of \nDirectors. In addition, several afiliates have proceeded with local \nrisk mapping exercises.\n\nRegarding health & Safety, external audits are held to identify \npotential risks on all our sites, followed by a close monitoring of \nthe given recommendations. This leads to initiatives at a global \nscale allowing reduction of risks (see Section\xa04.1.1.6: health, safety \nand wellbeing).\n\nWith respect to environmental risks, Capgemini has an Environmental \nManagement System (ISO\xa014001: 2015 certificate) which allows it \nto identify and manage this category of risks, in compliance with \nthe national and international regulatory frameworks in force \nand its own objectives. Altran also has ISO\xa014001\xa0certification in \nplace in a selection of its strategic sites and it is intended to extend \nCapgemini’s global certificate to cover Altran in the next few years.\n\nA Climate Change Risk Assessment process was added in 2017, \ndeployed in five countries and redeveloped in 2020, with a focus \non a wider set of risks and greater alignment with the Group risk \nassessment process (see Section\xa04.1.3\xa0Environmental sustainability). \nThe new process has been piloted in Germany and North America \nand is currently being deployed in India.\n\nResponsible Purchasing\n\nOur supply chain both serves our clients and ensures that our \ninternal operations are conducted properly. We strive to guarantee \nthat it is in line with our ethical imperatives and that it meets the \nexpectations of our clients. For over ten years, the Group has had a \nmandatory purchase order policy and a Global Purchasing System, \nwhich gives a clear picture of all our activities in this respect from \nsourcing to payment. Capgemini plans to integrate the Altran \nentities in the same global platform (see below “Focus on Altran”).\n\nCapgemini’s Procurement department complies with the Blue \nBook, which includes the Group’s values, our ethics, compliance and \nCSR policies, and respects all the national and international legal \nand regulatory frameworks in place (see Section\xa03.1.1\xa0Definition \nof internal control and risk management system).\n\nCapgemini’s Global Purchasing System currently has more than \n37,000\xa0active suppliers and subcontractors. having such a large \nsupply chain, covering several continents, raises a number of issues \nand can lead to risks. As such, we remain vigilant about defending \nhuman rights and preserving the environment. The importance that \nwe attach to suppliers’ relationships is reflected in all the guidelines \nrelated to selecting and managing our suppliers and their ethics.\n\n4.3.2 Our achievements\n\nAssessment of supplier risks\n\nAn assessment process is included in the referencing procedure \nfor our suppliers using a digital platform. It aims to identify and \nprevent financial and non-financial risks, and it covers the risks \nof unethical reputation and more specifically corruption in our \npotential partners.\n\nIf necessary, mitigation measures can be defined, and corrective \naction plans may be required. Suppliers presenting a serious risk \nmay be excluded.\n\nFocus on sustainable procurement in the United \nKingdom\n\nSince 2015, Capgemini UK assesses risk of slavery and human \ntraficking in its organization and supply chains, thus complying with \nthe UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 and strengthening the Company’s \ncommitment to human rights across the supply chain. Capgemini’s \nTransparency Statement is available to all stakeholders on the \nGroup’s website https://www.capgemini.com/gb-en/resources/\nmodern-slavery-transparency-statement. It states that Capgemini \nUK has a zero-tolerance approach with regard to human rights \nabuse such as forced and compulsory labor, slavery, servitude, \nand human traficking.\n\nCapgemini UK is committed to its employees, clients and suppliers \nto take appropriate steps to eradicate modern slavery in the \nbusiness and the supply chain. A risk mitigation plan is in place to \nensure continuous improvement which includes general Capgemini \nUK population training as well as specialist training. The Company \nmaintains a policy prohibiting agents and sub-contractors from \nengaging in modern slavery and requires that our Company \npromptly terminates any agents, sub-contractors or sub-contractor’s \nemployees who have engaged in modern slavery-related activities.\n\nIn particular, the UK Procurement team assesses all new suppliers \nand re-assesses existing suppliers annually. The scope includes \nethics, anti-bribery, modern slavery, labor law, environment, health \n& Safety, business continuity and social value. In 2020, more than \n1,390\xa0suppliers have been assessed. Amongst them, 6\xa0suppliers \nwere found to be non-compliant and deactivated. The assessment \nsystem is now being used as part of the selection process for global \nrequest for proposals (RFPs).\n\n4.3.2.2  Measures to mitigate risks and/or prevent \nserious breaches\n\nTo comply with the duty of care obligations, Capgemini has \nimplemented specific measures:\n\nEthics and Compliance Programs\n\nOur Ethics & Compliance principles and programs, our CSR strategy \nand all the Group’s policies, in particular our Code of Business Ethics, \nreflect our commitments and provide guidance on their effective \napplication in every aspect of our activity, in every country in which \nwe operate. In our decentralized organization, every legal entity \nhas an obligation to comply with those principles as well as with \nlocal legislation, translating the Group’s commitment into concrete \nlocal policies and actions that further improve human rights within \nour scope of activity (see Section\xa04.2 for more details).\n\nhttps://www.capgemini.com/gb-en/resources/modern-slavery-transparency-statement\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nDuty of care\n\n194 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n4.\n\nSupplier Standards of Conduct\n\nSince 2015, Capgemini has implemented Supplier Standards of \nConduct, which formalize the standards that will be applied and \nenforced in its business relationships with its partners and suppliers. \n\nThe terms of the Standards of Conduct define the prerequisites \nregarding ethics and compliance, Corporate Social Responsibility \nand sustainable development, in particular ensuring that our \nsuppliers are committing to supporting 8\xa0of the 17\xa0United Nations \nSustainable Development Goals.\n\nThe Supplier Standards of Conduct also sets out our policy regarding \nthe terms of our trade relations with our suppliers, such as the \nmandatory purchase order as a prerequisite to any commercial \ncommitment These principles apply to all suppliers and all the \ncountries where Capgemini operates.\n\nThe Supplier Standards of Conduct are available at the following \nlink (in English): https://www.capgemini.com/our-company/supplier-\nstandards-of-conduct.\n\nIn addition, our suppliers are informed in this document that they \ncan use the Group’s helpline (SpeakUP) to report any alerts and/\nor ask for advice and guidance about actions or behavior that (1) \nare not aligned with our values or our Code of Business Ethics \nand related Ethics & Compliance policies, (2) not in compliance \nwith applicable law, or (3) may significantly affect vital interests \nof Capgemini and its afiliates. (see Section\xa03.2.1\xa0Critical risks).\n\nIn 2020, 38% of procurement was covered by our Supplier Standards \nof Conduct. The referencing procedure for our suppliers now \nincorporates their formal commitment to the terms of this code, \nusing a fully digital process, to improve the way our policy is \nimplemented in this regard.\n\nSupplier Relationship Management Program\n\nSupplier Relationship Management or SRM is one of the main roles \nof the Procurement department, and without a doubt, the most \nimpactful in the long run. It enables Capgemini and its suppliers to \nalign their roadmaps, optimize operational performance, encourage \nco-innovation, positively affect the total cost of ownership, and \nkeep risks under control, including ethical risks. This requires \norganization, clear communication plans and regular performance \nreviews covering all aspects of the commercial relationship to be \nfully aligned. It fosters trust at decision-making level and ensures \nbetter cooperation in achieving shared objectives.\n\nSince 2015, Capgemini’s procurement department has been \nimplementing a program to build a robust supplier base, and boost \nrelations with our main trading partners to create value for the \nGroup’s clients. This program also aims to reduce our exposure \nto supply risk and control any discrepancies with our supplier \nrelationship policy.\n\nCapgemini’s Procurement department assesses all aspects of supplier \nrelationships using a Time, Quality, Responsiveness, Delivery, Cost \nand Environment approach. It implements this program with the \nsupport of a digital platform, so this approach can be extended \nto a wider range of suppliers.\n\nIn 2020, the SRM program covered 69\xa0suppliers, resulting in shared \naction plans, monitored with our suppliers’ senior executives.\n\nDigitization of the procurement process\n\nCapgemini has deployed a digital platform to cover the sourcing \nand procurement processes end-to-end in order to make sure \nits Supplier Relationship Management policy is properly applied.\n\nFocus on Altran\n\nTo bring its supplier relationships within a responsible purchasing \nprocess and adopt uniform practices throughout the world, Altran \ndeployed a group purchasing policy in 2019. This policy set outs \nthe principles of collaboration with suppliers, such as contracting, \nrequest for proposal (RFP) processes or performance monitoring, \nand includes ethical criteria, in addition to Altran’s ethical charter \nand anti-corruption policy.\n\nWith the aim of strengthening the control of risks at each stage \nof the purchasing process, Altran has decided to opt for overall \nmanagement of suppliers and subcontractors, through the setting up \na central database of relationships with suppliers and subcontractors \n(the e-Proc tool) as from 2019. The centralized management of \nthis purchasing database, which includes roughly 12,000\xa0activated \nsuppliers, can control, and improve the management of the choice \nand monitoring of the Group’s suppliers and subcontractors.\n\nIn 2019, Altran also improved its referencing policy, via the adoption \nof additional and mandatory documents required from new \nsuppliers and subcontractors. Altran has distributed its Supplier \nConduct Guidelines, which set out the commitments of suppliers \nand subcontractors, and specify requirements in terms of respect \nfor human rights and environmental regulations and which are \nbased on internationally recognized principles, such as the Universal \nDeclaration of human Rights, the United Nations Global Compact, \nthe guidelines of the OECD for multinational companies, and the \nInternational Labor Organization (ILO) standards. In particular, they \nrequire Altran’s suppliers and subcontractors to prohibit child labor \nand forced labor, to ensure decent working conditions that are \nhealthy and free of hazards for all employees, to fight corruption \nand to respect the environment and preserve natural resources.\n\nThese Guidelines, which must be accepted through e-Proc, are \nbinding upon suppliers and subcontractors. Altran requires each \nof them to comply with the ethical principles of the Group and \nexpects these Supplier Conduct Guidelines to be complied with \nby all their employees and subcontractors. Since the deployment \nif the e-Proc database, 60% of new suppliers have signed up to \nthe Supplier Conduct Guidelines.\n\nAltran has informed its suppliers that the Capgemini Supplier \nStandards of Conduct shall apply as of January\xa02021.\n\nhttps://www.capgemini.com/our-company/supplier-standards-of-conduct\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nMethodology and scope for non‑financial information\n\nCAPGEMINI 195\n\n4.\n\nHuman Rights\n\nhuman rights protection applies to our employees across our \nentire supply chain.\n\nCapgemini’s commitment to human rights has been deeply rooted \nin the Group’s values and culture since its creation in 1967. The \nprotection of human rights includes freedom of expression, \nfreedom of association, and prohibiting child and forced labor. \nFreedom is one of the Group’s seven values as defined by Serge \nKampf, its founder.\n\nIn 2021, as in 2020, Capgemini was recognized as One of the \nWorld’s Most Ethical Companies by the Ethisphere Institute (see \nSection\xa04.2\xa0Ethics & Compliance).\n\nAs an ethically responsible company, we comply \nwith the Principles of the Universal human Rights \nDeclaration of 1948 and the fundamental conventions \nof the International Labor Organization (ILO) refusing \nthe use of forced and child labor, in alignment with \n\nthe United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 8.\n\nThis commitment is further embodied by the signature of the UN \nGlobal Compact in 2004. Accordingly, we support and comply with \nthe ten principles in the areas of environment, human rights, labor \nrights, and the fight against corruption. Our Ethics & Compliance \nprinciples and programs, our CSR strategy and all the Group’s policies \n(human resources, Procurement…) reflect this commitment and \nprovide guidance on their effective application in every aspect of \nour activity, in every country in which we operate.\n\nLikewise, Altran has also expressed its commitment to the same \nvalues in its own Ethical Charter and has signed up to the UN \nGlobal Compact.\n\nEmployee Health and Safety\n\nOur local policies ensure that the Group’s standards are applied \nto all our employees, in all the countries where we operate (see \nSection\xa04.1.1\xa0People & Inclusion).\n\nAll our suppliers and subcontractors are required to comply with \nthe same demanding standards in their respective countries, \nin accordance with our Supplier Standards of Conduct (see \nSection\xa04.3.2.2).\n\nEnvironment\n\nAs a global group operating in nearly 50\xa0countries around the world, \nwe need to ensure we have rigorous procedures in place to manage \nand reduce our environmental impacts and respond to an increasingly \ncomplex legislative landscape (see Section\xa04.1.3\xa0Environmental \nSustainability).\n\nSupply chain risks are included in the Environmental Management \nSystem and are also part of our supplier management process. In \nthis regard, environmental incidents, and emergencies – particularly \nin relation to suppliers – are dealt with in accordance with the \nprocedures in the Group’s Environmental Management System.\n\n4.3.2.3  Reporting System \n\nThe ethics helpline, SpeakUP, is open to our team members, \ncustomers, suppliers, and business partners to report alerts and/\nor ask for advice and guidance about actions or behavior that (1) \nare not aligned with our values, our Code of Business Ethics and \nrelated Ethics & Compliance policies, (2) not in compliance with \napplicable laws, or (3) may significantly affect vital interests of \nCapgemini and its afiliates. See Section\xa04.2.1 for more details.\n\nOur suppliers have been informed of the availability of the Group’s \nhelpline (SpeakUP) in the Supplier Standards of Conduct (see \nSection\xa04.3.2.2).\n\n4.3.2.4  Monitoring and Evaluation System\n\nMonitoring of the Group’s duty of care is part of the Group’s \nEthics and Compliance programs – for more details on ethics and \ncompliance governance see Section\xa03.1.3.\n\nThe Group has set up a non-financial reporting system including \nkey performance indicators to measure the results of the policies \nimplemented throughout the Group, including the subsidiaries (see \nSection\xa04.4: Methodology and Scope of Non-Financial information).\n\nRegarding the supply chain, several key performance indicators \nwere implemented to assess the effectiveness of our policies:\n\n—  share of procurement covered by the Supplier Standards of \nConduct; \n\n—  number of suppliers covered by the Global Purchasing \nSystem; and\n\n—  share of employees having completed the e-learning module \non Code of Business Ethics, Competition Laws Policy and \nAnti-corruption policy.\n\n4.4  Methodology and scope for non‑financial \ninformation\n\n4.4.1  Alignment with French legal requirements on \nDéclaration de performance extra‑financière\n\n4.4.1.1  Legal requirements \n\nFollowing the implementation in France of the European directive \n2014/95/UE of 22\xa0October\xa02014 with regards to the disclosure of social \nand environmental information (19\xa0July\xa02017), Capgemini publishes \nits statement on non-financial performance in its management \nreport. As a listed company, Capgemini must disclose in the 2020 \nreport its action plan to measure the social and environmental \nconsequences of its activities, including information on the \nconsequences of its activity on human rights and on the fight \n\nagainst corruption and tax evasion. The non-financial information \nto be disclosed is described as follows:\n\na)  the Company’s business model, including key resources, main \nactivities, main achievements, strategy; \n\nb)  the main non-financial risks related to the Company’s activity \nor the use of its products and services; \n\nc) t he policies implemented to manage these risks (including \ndue diligence procedures, where applicable); and\n\nd) t he actions implemented during the year and the results of \nthese policies, including performance indicators.\n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nMethodology and scope for non‑financial information\n\n196 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n4.\n\nWe have structured the different Sections of the reports as follows:\n\na)  Capgemini’s business model highlights our value creation \nmodel and resources. For more information, please refer \nto Section\xa01.1.3 for a description of our four main activities, \n1.1.4 for our offers’ description, Section\xa01.2\xa0dealing with our \nmarket, our competitive environment, our relations with \nstrategic partners and dialogue with stakeholders, and to \nSection\xa01.3 for a deeper overview of our business strategy; \n\nb)  the main risks related to the activity of the Company are \npresented in three Sections:\n\n—  Section\xa03.2.1: Presentation of the Group critical risks to \nbe disclosed in the non-financial information reporting,\n\n—  Section\xa0 3.2.2: Presentation of Corporate & Social \nResponsibility materiality assessment,\n\n—  Chapter\xa0 4: Details of each material topic (non-financial \nreporting).\n\nIn line with the framework published by the International Integrated \nReporting Council (IIRC), material topics are defined as the economic, \nsocial, and environmental issues that influence the organization’s \nability to create value. This is determined by considering their \neffect on the organization’s strategy, governance, performance, \nor prospects.\n\nWe present our non-financial risks related to our business model \nin a double manner: we have decided to identify both our material \nrisks and topics to be included in this non-financial information by \nrelying on two methodologies for assessing risk and materiality \nat the Group level. Indeed, to ensure the exhaustivity of our risk \nanalysis, we performed an analysis of the Group risk mapping \n(see Section\xa03.2.2), the materiality assessment and a dedicated \nnon-financial risk mapping.\n\nThe materiality assessment aims at identifying economic, social, \nenvironmental and governance material topics considering \ninternal and external stakeholders. In 2014, we carried out our first \nmateriality analysis. In 2018, we gathered insights from a panel of \nstakeholders, which led to a strategic dialogue between internal \nand external viewpoints and the strengthening of our materiality \nanalysis. We represented Capgemini’s full ecosystem and prioritized \nour stakeholders based on our level of engagement with them. By \nquestioning senior managers representing the Group’s leadership, \nwe identified and selected topics that had an impact on our ability \nto create long-term value (see Section\xa03.2.2 for more details on \nmateriality assessment methodology). In 2020, we established \nthe non-financial risk mapping to meet requirements of article \nR.\xa0225-105\xa0of the French Commercial Code (Non-Financial Reporting \nDirective) and the French law on duty of care, leveraging the \nwork done earlier. The Group’s Compliance and Risk Management \ndepartments approved this approach.\n\nWe identified 32\xa0significant risks related to 15\xa0non-financial material \ntopics to be reported in the context of this new regulation, and \nthen matched these subjects with the corresponding existing and \noverlapping critical risks within the Group. Those material topics \nare aligned with our Corporate, Social Responsibility & human \nResources strategies presented in the introduction of this Chapter. \nFor each significant risk, we set out the policies implemented to \nmitigate related risks or missed opportunities, and the results of \npolicies with related key performance indicators. The materiality \n\nassessment and Group critical risk mapping methodologies are \nset out in Chapter\xa03.

Six main areas have been covered: human \nDevelopment related to talent, human Rights into the supply chain, \nhealth and Safety, Respect for the Environment, Data protection \nand Client Sustainability Objectives.\n\nThe methodology used was aligned with the Group’s risk mapping \nmethodology, which assesses for each risk a level of impact and \nlikelihood. The impact is calculated according to 5\xa0main criteria: \nBusiness Impact, Financial Impact, Safety and Security, Ethics and \nCompliance and Reputation. The prospect has been weighted \nthanks to the Sustainable Development Goals Index per country \n(first worldwide index to assess where each country stands with \nregard to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals) and \nstakeholder expectations through sector reference frameworks \n(Sustainability Accounting Standards Board and Global Reporting \nInitiative). Certain contextual factors such as the health crisis were \nconsidered as aggravating factors. A temporal dimension also plays \na role in the assessment of likelihood.\n\nThis mapping was carried out with the help of the Ethics, Compliance, \nLegal, Procurement, CSR and hR teams and was approved by the \nCompliance and Risk Management teams. It was presented to the \nAudit & Risk Committee of the Board of Directors on February\xa03rd, \n2021.\n\nThe 32\xa0risks identified are presented in the correspondence table \nbelow, in connection with the 15\xa0material non-financial topics from \nMaterial topics (from 2018 materiality assessment, confirmed in \n2019). The correspondence table between the critical risks from \nthe Group risk mapping and the significant non-financial risks is \npresented in Section\xa04.4.1.3.\n\n4.4.1.3  Significant Non‑financial risks and material \ntopics included in the DPEF\n\nThe table below presents the non-financial material topics and \nsignificant non-financial risks related to our business model and \necosystem and where it is reported on in the document.

\n—  food waste; \n—  animal condition and wellbeing; \n—  responsible, sustainable and fair food.\n\n4.4.2  Methodology and scope of non‑financial performance indicators\n\nWe decided to present the key performance indicators for each \nmaterial topic according to the following structure:\n\n—  indicator results for 2019;\n—  indicator results for 2020 (except for new KPIs).\n\nFor any significant change between 2019 and 2020, explanations \nare provided.\n\nConsistency checks and trend analysis are performed regularly to \nguarantee the quality of data, and in case of doubt or inaccuracies, \ncorresponding data is excluded. The coverage rate specified for each \nindicator is reported in the content of the report and summarized \nbelow (4.4.2); when a methodological explanation is necessary, it \nis provided in that paragraph.\n\n4.4.2.1  Focus on HR, labor indicators, Learning and \nDevelopment indicators\n\nThe Group’s HR and labor data comes from several sources, for \ngeneral management and reporting purposes:\n\n—  The Group’s financial reporting tool, which provides data \nreported monthly or quarterly using common indicators, \nsuch as total permanent headcount (permanent and \nfixed-term contracts including non-actively working, \nexcluding temporary agencies staff, individual freelancers, \nindependent workers, subcontractors, trainees) and \nmovements (hires/acquisitions/departures/attrition rate) as \nof December\xa031, 2020. The scope of this data is Group-wide \nand therefore, there is a link between the sustainability \nreporting and the financial reporting.\n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nMethodology and scope for non‑financial information\n\nCAPGEMINI 199\n\n4.\n\n—  An internal Business Intelligence (BI) tool, which is interfaced \nwith most local human resources systems within the \nCapgemini legacy environment. It provides monthly statistics \non seniority, age range, gender and grade, wherever allowed \nby law. 97% of Group employee’s data excluding Altran (1) \nis consolidated within this tool. A few countries are not \ninterfaced though, due to either very stringent regulations \non data protection (Germany), or time required to obtain \nagreement and build the appropriate interfaces, in particular \nfor acquired companies.\n\n—  The Employee Engagement indicators are taken from the \nPulse platform run by an external provider used to run the \nengagement surveys. Glassdoor scores are taken from the \nCapgemini profile page on the Glassdoor website, which \nis an external and independent provider of this external \nattractiveness data.\n\n—  An internal tool covering Altran employee data, which is \ninterfaced with most local human resources systems within \nthe Altran environment enabling to collect data around \nseniority, gender, age range (whenever legal).\n\nAltran data have been added to the Capgemini legacy data to \nform a consolidated picture from our employee movements and \ndemographics.\n\nRegarding the diversity indicators:\n\n— t he proportion of women in Executive Leaders (Section\xa04.1.1.1) \nrepresents the proportion of Group Position holders being \nwomen, i.e. the important positions at Group level; \n\n— t he proportion of women in Executive position (Section \n4.1.1.1) represents the % of women in Director and Vice-\nPresident positions (E and F grades).\n\nRegarding the breakdown by age, the data are automatically \ncalculated and follow a rounding process which may lead in some \ncases to classify someone in the upper age range (example: someone \naged 24.9 as of December\xa031\xa0will be rounded at 25 and counted in \nthe 25-35\xa0range rather than in the 20-24\xa0range).\n\nFor Learning and Development, the Group has implemented a \nsystem accessible to all Capgemini employees, MyLearning. The \nsystem encompasses the full learning catalog (on site and virtual \ncourses, webcasts, videos…). It enables monitoring and tracking \nof the training delivered. on Altran scope, figures are tracked at \ncountry level within local training systems; annual figures are \nconsolidated once a year.\n\nhours of training tracked by the business units via MyLearning \nsystem are calculated based on the predefined duration of each \ntraining session (and not on the time effectively spent by employees \non the training).\n\nAs of 2017, all the training hours that were not tracked in the system \nare no longer reported. The reason for this is that tracked hours \nrepresent more than 96% of all formal learning in MyLearning, \nand we aim for it to be 100%. Reporting only on system-tracked \nhours allows us to have full visibility down to the individual learning \nactivity and secures an auditable trail.\n\n(1) Manual adjustments are made to integrate some missing data into the tool, thus increasing the coverage rate of these data.\n\n4.4.2.2  Focus on digital inclusion indicators\n\nBelow are criteria for projects falling under digital inclusion:\n\nDefinition\n\nA Digital Inclusion project/initiative can be any project that has an \nobjective of reducing the digital divide, giving disadvantaged and \ndigitally excluded people the necessary tools, means and skills to \nintegrate in the new world order shaped by automation and digital \nrevolution. Projects where we leverage the power of technology \nand innovation to solve societal issues and create positive impact \nare also Digital Inclusion projects.\n\nBeneficiaries\n\nBeneficiaries can be:\n\n— p eople who do not have any access to digital tools and are \nexcluded due to their lack of technological knowledge and \nskills e.g. the elderly, young school/college dropouts, former \noffenders, people with disabilities, migrants, homeless,\xa0etc.;\n\n—  disadvantaged youth who are NEET (Not in Education, \nEmployment or Training), people struggling with long term \nunemployment and those in transition such as refugees,\xa0etc.;\n\n—  individuals who need to be reskilled because they lost their \nlivelihood as a result of automation;\n\n—  individuals suffering from social or societal challenges which \ncan be tackled with a digital solution. \n\nObjectives\n\nAn initiative will have to support either of the following objectives \nto be classified as digital inclusion project by the Group:\n\n—  help marginalized populations to be connected to the “e” \nworld: facilitating access to digital means and/or trainings \nto use technology in order to be more autonomous \nregarding public and daily services (health, administration, \neducation,\xa0 etc.) for disadvantaged or marginalized \nindividuals;\n\n—  inspire youth towards digital and opportunities in STEM \n(Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math streams): \nenabling younger generations to develop digital skills, \nthereby inspiring them to broaden their career’s scope;\n\n—  train and reskill in digital to facilitate employment: specialized \ntraining or reskilling of disadvantaged populations in market \nrelevant digital skills with the aim of finding sustainable \nemployment in the new world of work. This category of \nprojects focused on enabling employment will qualify as a \nDigital Academy project;\n\n—  develop a technology solution to address/solve key societal \nissues of our times (climate change, poverty, socio-economic \ninequalities, healthcare,\xa0etc.),\n\nSocial/community impact projects cover any project with the aim \nof bringing a sustainable social and environmental impact in local \ncommunities will be called a social/community impact project. \nProjects supported/sponsored by the Diversity and/or Environmental \nSustainability Pillars will not be classified under this category.\n\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nMethodology and scope for non‑financial information\n\n200 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n4.\n\nImplementation of social impact projects in the \ncontext of digital inclusion\n\nTo measure the alignment to digital inclusion at the end of 2020, \nwe have focused on the number of digital inclusion initiatives as \na percentage of the total number of social/community impact \ninitiatives.\n\nAlso, we have taken into consideration 17\xa0countries covering almost \n90% of our headcount at the end of December\xa02019 (India, France, \nUnited Kingdom, United States, Canada, Germany, Netherlands, \nSpain, Poland, Guatemala, Morocco, Australia, Italy, China, Brazil, \nBelgium and Sweden). Their social impact initiatives condition their \nprogress towards the 80% alignment goal for 2020.\n\nExtrapolation method: as the focus was on 17\xa0countries, we are \nat 91.3% alignment on digital inclusion globally at the end of \n2020. Extrapolating this for the entire Group, i.e. for 100% of our \nheadcount, the overall alignment towards Digital Inclusion is 87.3%.\n\n4.4.2.3  Focus on Environmental Sustainability \nindicators\n\nWe measure and track our environmental impact through our \nglobal carbon accounting program. This process is facilitated by a \nweb-based carbon accounting tool through which we gather more \nthan 10\xa0million data points every year, enabling us to analyze our \ndata to a very granular level. Data on our key environmental impacts \n(energy usage, travel, F-gas, waste and water) is collected from \n35\xa0countries representing 99% of Group headcount, with estimated \ndata for the remaining 1% of our operations. One central team \nmanages the data processing and validation, to ensure consistent, \nhigh quality and accurate data is available across the Group.\n\nOur Greenhouse Gas (GhG) emissions are calculated following the \nmethodology outlined by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate \nReporting and Accounting Standard, using an operational control \napproach. Our Group-wide commitment to improving our environmental \nperformance is underpinned by a set of environmental targets \nwhich are validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) \nas being in line with the level of reduction needed to limit global \ntemperature increases to no more than 1.5°C above pre-industrial \nlevels (see Section\xa04.1.3.1 for details). These targets cover our \nentire global operations.\n\nAll GhG emissions, except electricity, are calculated using the \nemission factors recommended by the UK Government’s Emission \nFactors. For electricity, as per the GhG Protocol, we calculate \nemissions in two ways, using both the market-based and the \nlocation-based approach.\n\n—  Market-based emissions are calculated using supplier-specific \nemission factors where possible. Where these are not \navailable, we have used a residual fuel mix factor, sourced \nfor from RE-DISS for countries in Europe and from  \ngreen-e.org for US and Canada. For a few smaller entities, \nwe have assumed an emission factor of 0 for electricity \npurchased on renewable energy tariffs. In locations where \nneither supplier-based nor residual fuel mix factors are \navailable, we have used a location-based emission factor.\n\n—  For the location-based approach, regional electricity \nemission factors have been applied for the UK (BEIS 2020), \nAustralia (NGA), Canada (Canada National Inventory), China \n(China National Bureau of Statistics), and the US (eGrid). For \nall the other countries, emission factors from International \nEnergy Agency (IEA) have been applied to calculate Scope \n2\xa0 location-based emissions. Scope 3 “T&D losses” refers to \nelectricity transmission and distribution grid losses i.e. the \nenergy loss that occurs in transmitting the electricity from \nthe generation source to our facilities.\n\nWhere possible, we gather actual data – such as kWh from digital \nmetering systems or invoices and mileage data from travel agents \nand expense systems, with 84% of our reported emissions data \ncoming from actual data. The chart below provides a summary of \nthe percentage of actual data by source for our most significant \ndata sources.\n\nChart: Summary of Data Quality by Source\n\n100 KTons CO₂e\n\n90\n\n80\n\n70\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\nEstimated or extrapolated data\n\nConverted data\n\nActual data\n\nTrains \n& taxis\n\nData center \nelectricity\n\nAir \ntravel\n\nCar\ntravel\n\nHotelsOffice \nelectricity\n\n90%\n\n70%\n\n88%\n\n75%\n\n82%\n15%\n\nThe chart above indicates the data quality of the key data sources for \n2020, with the percentage relating to the percentage of emissions \nthat are calculated based on actual data. “Converted data” refers to \nactual data which has been converted from one unit to another for \nthe purpose of calculating emissions – for example for our taxi and \ntrain travel, the majority of the data is converted from the actual \ncost data into miles based on average ratios in each country. Data \nis “Estimated or Extrapolated” in the following cases:\n\n—  when actual data has been delayed beyond the reporting \ndeadline – this report is prepared in early January\xa02021, by \nwhich point not all invoices and expenses are submitted so \ndata is temporarily estimated and replaced by actual data \nwhen it becomes available. In this report, this is particularly \nthe case for some Altran entities which are new to carbon \naccounting and have been integrated into Capgemini’s \nsystems for the first time. For Altran entities that have not \nbeen able to collect data in time, data is estimated based on \nsimilar Capgemini entities; \n\n—  when a small entity does not have the resources available to \ncollect the data – we report data on 98.6% of operations by \nheadcount, the remaining proportion is in smaller entities, \ntypically where there are less than 250\xa0employees. In these \ncountries, data is estimated based on the data of another \nentity in the same country or based on the group average – \nwith the estimation adjusted in proportion to the floor area/\nheadcount; \n\n— w hen we do not have operational control of a facility \nand therefore do not have access to invoices and plant \ninfrastructure – in many cases landlords and building owners \ndo provide actual data anyway, but in some cases, we use \nestimations to fill data gaps; \n\n—  when we are a tenant of a shared facility with no sub-metering \nor tenant-specific data – in this case data is allocated based \non floor area or number of employees; \n\n—  a percentage of employees do not book their travel through \nthe approved travel agency – to account for these cases we \nextrapolate the data by applying a percentage uplift to the \ntravel agency data.\n\nhttp://green-e.org\n\n\nOUR COMMITMENT AS A RESPONSIBLE LEADER  \nMethodology and scope for non‑financial

results\n\n5.1.1  General comments on the Group’s activity in 2020\n\n(1) The €0.7\xa0billion excess was allocated to the redemption of the bond issue maturing in July\xa02020.\n\nCapgemini demonstrated remarkable agility in 2020, rapidly \nadapting to an unprecedented crisis and completing the acquisition \nand integration of Altran, while delivering results in line with or \nexceeding objectives announced during the publication of the 2020 \nfirst-half results. With revenues of €15,848\xa0million in 2020, the \nGroup reported constant currency growth of 13.7%, at the upper \nend of the +12.5% to +14.0% target range. The operating margin \nrate was 11.9% of revenues, a limited contraction of 40\xa0basis points \ncompared to an expected contraction of 60\xa0to 90\xa0bp. Finally, organic \nfree cash flow generation totaled €1,119\xa0million, significantly higher \nthan the target figure of €900\xa0million.\n\nThe development of the activity over the past year reflects these two \nmajor facts. Firstly, the Group completed the acquisition of Altran \nTechnologies (“Altran”), consolidated from April\xa01, 2020, making \nCapgemini the partner of choice for the digital transformation \nof industrial and technology companies. Secondly, Capgemini \nsuccessfully dealt with the consequences of the pandemic crisis, \nwith its results demonstrating the strong resilience of its operations \nand financial model.\n\nAcquisition of Altran\n\nIn 2020, Capgemini successfully completed the friendly tender offer \nfor Altran. Altran is a world leader in Engineering and Research \n& Development (R&D) services, with revenues of €3.2\xa0billion in \n2019 and a strong client base, considerable sector expertise and \nin-depth knowledge of new product developments, industry \nbusiness processes and operational technologies.\n\nWith the acquisition of Altran, Capgemini benefits from a unique \nability to support industrial and technology companies in their \ndigital transformation. The new Group can rely on its in-depth \nknowledge of its clients’ businesses, its privileged access to \ndecision-makers and its portfolio of businesses covering Consulting \nServices in innovation and transformation, a wide range of digital \nand cloud-based offerings as well as recognized product and \nsoftware engineering capabilities. With these strong points, \nCapgemini strengthens its role as a strategic partner for its clients \nin the Intelligent Industry segment.\n\nImpact of the acquisition on revenues and the Group’s \nbusiness profile\n\nThe takeover of Altran became effective on March\xa0 13, 2020 \nand Altran’s results are fully consolidated in the Group financial \nstatements from April\xa01, 2020. A detailed description of this \n€3.7\xa0billion transaction and its implementation is provided in \nNote\xa02\xa0to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nFrom the second quarter, Capgemini therefore benefited fully \nfrom the consolidation of Altran in the Group scope, which more \nthan offset the pandemic’s impact on revenues in the last three \nquarters of the year. 2020 revenues of the new combined entity \ntherefore grew +13.7% at constant exchange rates and -3.2% \nat constant scope and exchange rates. This so-called “organic” \ngrowth is calculated with respect to the combined 2019 revenues \nof Capgemini and Altran (and other small acquisitions) for the \nrelevant periods.\n\nDue to the relatively comparable geographic spread of the two \ncompanies, Altran’s consolidation did not significantly alter the \nbreakdown of the new entity’s revenues by major geographic region. \nFor fiscal year 2020 as a whole, including Altran’s contribution \nfrom the second quarter, North America remained the Group’s \nleading region (31% of Group revenues vs. 32% in 2019), followed \nby the Rest of Europe (29% vs. 27% in 2019), France (22% vs. 21% \nin 2019), the United Kingdom and Ireland (11% vs. 12% in 2019) and \nAsia-Pacific and Latin America (7% vs. 8% in 2019).\n\nThe Group’s business mix changed noticeably from Q2 2020 with the \nintegration of Altran which primarily delivers Engineering Services. \nWhile Strategy & Transformation Consulting Services continued \nto generate 7% of Group total revenues in 2020, Operations & \nEngineering Services now account for 31% of Group business (vs. \n22% in 2019), while Applications & Technology Services remain the \nGroup’s core business, but now only represent 62% of Group total \nrevenues (vs. 71% in 2019).\n\nIntegration and synergies\n\nThe integration process was launched following the effective \ntakeover of Altran and is progressing in line with Group expectations. \nIt notably led to the implementation of an integrated operating \nstructure on January\xa01, 2021. In the second half of 2020, Capgemini \nalso launched its first three Intelligent Industry offerings focusing \non 5G and Edge computing, driving automation systems validation \nand verification and data driven R&D for Life Sciences.\n\nFull-year cost and operating model synergies of between €70\xa0million \nand €100\xa0million, before tax, are expected as communicated on the \nannouncement of the acquisition project. Capgemini now expects \nto reach a run-rate of two-thirds of these synergies in June\xa02021. \nMoreover, based on contracts already signed since the combination \nof the two entities and the many commercial opportunities already \nidentified, the Group is confident it can achieve the commercial \nsynergies announced, which represent additional annual revenues \nof between €200\xa0million and €350\xa0million within three years.\n\nDeal Financing\n\nThe Altran acquisition was financed in line with the financing plan \npresented in June\xa02019 (€5.4\xa0billion, encompassing €3.7\xa0billion for \nthe purchase of securities and €1.7\xa0billion of gross debt carried by \nAltran). Capgemini used available cash of approximately €1.0\xa0billion \n(including €0.4\xa0billion for the purchase of a share block in 2019) \nand issued bonds for the balance.\n\nIn April\xa0 2020, the Group therefore performed a €3.5\xa0 billion \nmulti-tranche bond issue, €2.8\xa0billion of which was used to finance \nthe acquisition (1). The Altran term loans were then refinanced in \nJune\xa02020 through a second multi-tranche bond issue of €1.6\xa0billion. \nThese refinancing transactions extended the average maturity of \nthe Group’s bond debt to 6\xa0years, with a low average cost of 1.8%.\n\n\n\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION \nAnalysis of Capgemini group consolidated results\n\nCAPGEMINI 211\n\n5.\n\nCovid-19 pandemic and activity trends over the year\n\nMomentum at the start of the year was broadly in line with the \nfourth quarter of 2019. The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on \nthe Group’s activities peaked in the second quarter, with the Group \nthen beginning a gradual recovery. By limiting the organic fall \nin revenues to 3.2% (i.e. at constant scope and exchange rates), \nthe Group demonstrated in 2020 how the sector and geographic \ndiversification of the client base and the high quality offer portfolio \ndeveloped in recent years have clearly reinforced the resilience of \nCapgemini’s revenues.\n\nAn abrupt crisis followed by a gradual recovery\n\nThe Covid-19 epidemic began to develop at the end of January \nbefore being recognized by the World health Organization as \na pandemic on March\xa011. In this context, Capgemini’s priority \nwas to ensure the health and Safety of its employees as well as \nthe continuity of services to its clients. The Group implemented \nprevention and protection measures even before lockdown was \nannounced and is naturally constantly monitoring compliance with \nthe decisions and recommendations of local public authorities. \nThrough proper planning and timely execution, leveraging its \ninternal investments, Capgemini was among the fastest in the \nindustry to massively deploy working-from-home (close to 95% \nof productive headcount at April\xa028, Q1 publication date) across \nits activities worldwide.\n\nThe Group was thus in a position, particularly thanks to its digital \ncapabilities, to provide all the services requested by its clients. \nFurthermore, the Group quickly implemented the client business \ncontinuity plans that it had prepared well in advance. Activity in \nthe first quarter was only slightly affected by the pandemic and \nthe Group recorded organic growth of +2.0%.\n\nConversely, the second quarter was marked by the impact of the \nlockdown and/or restriction measures taken by public authorities \non the activities of the Group’s clients and, more generally, on the \nglobal economy. The Group therefore recorded a -7.7% drop in \nrevenues in the second quarter on an organic basis.\n\nIn line with Group expectations, activity started to pick up gradually \nfrom the summer. Organic growth was therefore limited to -3.6% \nin the third quarter and further improved to a moderate -2.4% \ncontraction in the fourth quarter.\n\nContrasting impacts across the regions, sectors and \nbusinesses\n\nFor the year as a whole, France reported the greatest slump in activity \nat constant scope and exchange rates, contracting significantly more \nthan the Group average. The North America and United Kingdom \nregions also contracted organically but began a gradual recovery \nin the second half of the year, with even a return to growth in the \nfourth quarter for the United Kingdom. The Asia-Pacific and Latin \nAmerica region pursued strong organic growth, while the Rest \nof Europe region remained virtually stable. This disparity may be \nattributed to differences in the duration and severity of lockdown \nmeasures, as well as the sector mix in different countries.\n\nThe situation in the various sectors was also highly contrasted \nduring the past year. The Public Sector (13% of the new Group’s \nrevenues, see below) proved to be buoyant. Financial Services \n(the largest sector generating 25% of Group revenues) and TMT \n(Telecom, Media & Technology, 12% of Group revenues) resisted \nbetter than the Group average. Conversely, the Manufacturing \n(22% of Group revenues) and Services (6% of Group revenues, \nincluding transportation and tourism) sectors were logically the \nworst affected by the pandemic.\n\nFinally, again for the year as a whole, organic growth rates for \ncloud infrastructure services and Business Services (the Operations \nbusinesses) were relatively unaffected by the crisis, while the \nslowdown in Engineering and Strategy & Transformation Consulting \nServices exceeded the Group average. Applications & Technology \nservices proved to be slightly more resilient than the Group average.\n\nSolidarity measures with stakeholders\n\nIn view of this unique situation and the strict cost containment \nactions put in place, Capgemini also took several decisions aimed \nat building solidarity between the various stakeholders.\n\nOn April\xa027, 2020, the Board of Directors decided to reduce by 29% \nthe dividend paid in 2020 out of 2019 net profits from €1.90\xa0initially \nproposed to €1.35\xa0per share.\n\nFurthermore, Paul hermelin and Aiman Ezzat decided to go beyond \nthe AFEP recommendations by taking two decisions regarding \ntheir compensation. They each waived 25% of their 2020 total \ncompensation as executive corporate directors. In addition, \nduring the furlough period in France, their unpaid compensation \nas executive corporate directors was paid to the Institut Pasteur \nto finance Covid-19 research initiatives. These measures were \napproved by the Capgemini Board of Directors.\n\nCapgemini also created a “social response unit” to accelerate and \namplify the numerous initiatives already launched by the Group and \nits employees. This unit initially focused on the most urgent public \nhealth needs. It is also working on longer-term projects aimed at \ndeveloping solutions to address the economic and social impacts \non society in the aftermath of the pandemic.\n\nFinancial performance\n\nCapgemini reported revenues of €15,848\xa0million in 2020, up 12.2% \non 2019 published figures. Constant currency growth was 13.7%, \nat the upper end of the +12.5% to +14.0% target range. Organic \ngrowth (i.e. excluding the impact of currency fluctuations and \nchanges in Group scope) reported a measured contraction of \n-3.2% for the full year.\n\nThe Group therefore benefited from strategic developments \nlaunched in recent years to strengthen the resilience of its \nactivities. Digital and Cloud services (Group scope excluding Altran) \nin particular remained dynamic with constant currency growth of \naround 15% for the full year, in a crisis context that encouraged \nclients to prioritize critical digital transformation projects. Digital \nand Cloud services thus represented around 65% of total Group \nactivities in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nThe operating margin increased by +8% in value to €1,879\xa0million, \nrepresenting 11.9% of revenues. The contraction in the operating \nmargin rate year-on-year was therefore limited to 40\xa0bp, a better than \nexpected performance compared to the Group target contraction \nof 60\xa0to 90\xa0bp. This shows how the Group has substantially improved \nthe resilience of its operating model since the 2008-2009 crisis.\n\n\n\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION \nAnalysis of Capgemini group consolidated results\n\n212 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n5.\n\nOther operating income and expenses represent a net expense of \n€377\xa0million, up €69\xa0million year-on-year. This increase is due to \nthe consolidation of other operating expenses specific to Altran, \nas well as related acquisition and integration costs, only partially \noffset by the capital gain realized on the divestment of Odigo at \nthe end of the year.\n\nCapgemini operating profit is therefore up +5% at €1,502\xa0million, \nor 9.5% of revenues.\n\nThe financial expense is €147\xa0million, compared with €79\xa0million \nin 2019. This increase is due to the cost of financing the Altran \nacquisition and outstanding debt.\n\nThe income tax expense is €400\xa0million, an effective tax rate of \n29.5%. This amount includes income tax income of €8\xa0million due \nto the transitional impact of the US tax reform, compared with \nan income tax expense of €60\xa0million last year. The capital gain \nrealized on the divestment of Odigo is also not taxed. Adjusted for \nthese exceptional items, the effective tax rate is 33.0%, compared \nwith 32.6% in 2019.\n\nNet profit (Group share) grew 12% year-on-year to €957\xa0million. \nBasic earnings per share rose by 11% year-on-year to €5.71, while \nnormalized earnings per share increased 14% to €7.28. Normalized \nearnings per share adjusted for the transitional impact of the US \ntax reform increased 7% to €7.23.\n\nGroup cash from operations is €2,056\xa0million compared with \n€1,981\xa0million in 2019, mainly due to the increase in the operating \nmargin. Conversely, income tax payments totaled €351\xa0million, a \nmarked increase on 2019 (€217\xa0million). After a €44\xa0million increase \nin working capital requirements, net cash from operating activities \nfell to €1,661\xa0million from €1,794\xa0million in 2019. Acquisitions (net of \ndisposals) of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment \nfell slightly to €204\xa0million, representing 1.3% of revenues. Net \ninterest paid and received resulted in a cash outflow of €47\xa0million, \ncompared with €15\xa0million in 2019, mainly due to the increase in \nGroup net debt following the Altran acquisition (see below).\n\nOn this basis, organic free cash flow generation reached the \nremarkable level of €1,119\xa0million, largely exceeding the €900\xa0million \ntarget for 2020. Restated for the €225\xa0million impact of unwinding \nthe Altran factoring program, organic free cash flow generation \nexceeded the 2019 record level of €1,288\xa0million, demonstrating \nthe strength of the Group’s business model.\n\nIn 2020, Capgemini invested €2,999\xa0million net in external growth \ntransactions. This primarily reflects outflows in 2020 to acquire \nAltran, less net amounts received on the divestment of Odigo. \nThe 7th\xa0employee share ownership plan led to a gross share capital \nincrease of €279\xa0million. In addition, the Group paid €226\xa0million \nin dividends (equal to €1.35\xa0per share, following a 29% reduction \nin the initial proposal decided by the Board of Directors as part of \nsolidarity measures) and allocated €519\xa0million to share buybacks.\n\nCapgemini’s balance sheet structure changed significantly in the \npast year with the acquisition of Altran for an enterprise value of \n€5.2\xa0billion.\n\nAs the Altran securities were purchased in two separate stages \n(before and after the takeover became effective on March\xa013, 2020), \nin 2020 this transaction generated a €2.6\xa0billion increase in goodwill \n(€9.8\xa0billion at the closing date compared with €7.7\xa0billion at the \nopening date), new intangible assets for €0.5\xa0billion (€1.1\xa0billion at \nthe closing date compared with €0.6\xa0billion at the opening date), \nand a €2.1\xa0billion decrease in equity (€6.1\xa0billion at the closing date \ncompared with €8.4\xa0billion at the opening date).\n\nAt December\xa031, 2020, the Group had cash and cash equivalents \nand cash management assets of €3.2\xa0billion. After accounting for \nborrowings of €8.1\xa0billion and derivative instruments, Group net \ndebt is €4.9\xa0billion at December\xa031, 2020, compared with €0.6\xa0billion \nat December\xa031, 2019. This increase in net debt is primarily due \nto the Altran acquisition. It is lower than expected due to organic \nfree cash flow generation above expectations and the proceeds \nfrom the Odigo divestment.\n\n\n\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION \nAnalysis of Capgemini group consolidated results\n\nCAPGEMINI 213\n\n5.\n\nOperations by major region\n\n31%\n\nNorth America\n\n7%\n\nAsia-Pacific & Latin America\n\n22%\n\nFrance\n\n29%\n\nRest of Europe\n\n11%\n\nUnited Kingdom & Ireland\n\nRevenues in North America grew by +7.9% at constant exchange \nrates. This increase was driven by Altran’s contribution to revenues, \nmainly visible in the TMT sector. Financial Services enjoyed strong \nmomentum at the year end and reported organic growth for the \nfull year. The operating margin rate improved further to 14.8%, \ncompared with 13.9% in 2019.\n\nThe United Kingdom and Ireland region reported +6.7% constant \ncurrency growth in revenues, supported by Altran’s consolidation \n(mainly in the Manufacturing and TMT sectors) and robust Public \nSector momentum throughout the year on an organic basis. The \noperating margin increased to 15.5% from 15.2% a year earlier.\n\nFrance reported revenue growth of +14.2% at constant exchange \nrates for the period, with the Manufacturing, TMT and Energy & \nUtilities sectors significantly enhanced by the consolidation of Altran \nrevenues. On a like-for-like basis, the Manufacturing sector was the \nmost affected by the activity slowdown in the past year. Conversely, \nthe Public Sector maintained robust growth throughout the year. \nWithin the Group, France was the hardest hit by the pandemic, \nnotably due to an unfavorable mix of sectors and business lines. \nBoth revenues at constant scope and operating margin contracted \nvisibly, with the latter declining 3.4\xa0points year-on-year to 8.7%.\n\nThe Rest of Europe region grew +23.7% at constant exchange \nrates, including Altran revenues. Activity remained almost stable in \n2020 on an organic basis, supported by the buoyant Public Sector \nand TMT sector. The region reported a slightly lower operating \nmargin of 11.4%, compared with 11.8% a year earlier.\n\nFinally, momentum remained strong in the Asia-Pacific and Latin \nAmerica region, with revenues increasing +12.2% at constant \nexchange rates. This performance is particularly noteworthy as \nAltran’s consolidation had a more limited impact in this region. \nOrganic growth was again sustained, boosted particularly by \nFinancial Services and, to a lesser extent, the Services and TMT \nsectors. The operating margin rate increased significantly to 13.0% \nfrom 11.2% in 2019.\n\nOperations by business\n\n62%\n\nApplications\n& Technology\n\n7%\n\nStrategy &\nTransformation\n\n31%\n\nOperations &\nEngineering\n\nWhen determining activity trends by business and in accordance \nwith internal operating performance measures, growth at constant \nexchange rates is calculated based on total revenues, i.e. before \nelimination of inter-business billing. The Group considers this to be \nmore representative of activity levels by business. As its businesses \nchange, an increasing number of contracts require a range of \nbusiness expertise for delivery, leading to inter-business flows.\n\nStrategy & Transformation Consulting Services benefited from the \nintegration of high value-added Consulting Services developed by \nAltran in recent years, recording +11.0% growth in total revenues \nat constant exchange rates.\n\nApplications & Technology services, the Group’s core business, \nreported a slight -0.2% decline in total revenues at constant \nexchange rates. The Altran acquisition had only a limited impact \non growth at constant exchange rates in this service line.\n\n\n\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION \nAnalysis of Capgemini group consolidated results\n\n214 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n5.\n\nFinally, Operations & Engineering total revenues grew +55.5% at \nconstant exchange rates with the consolidation of Altran, which \nprimarily delivers Engineering Services.\n\nThe following table presents the utilization rates measuring \nthe percentage of work time, excluding vacation, of production \nemployees.\n\n2019 2020 \n\nUtilization rate Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 \n\nStrategy & Transformation (1)\n\nApplications & Technology\n\n70%\n\n78%\n\n72%\n\n79%\n\n70%\n\n79%\n\n72%\n\n80%\n\n69% \n\n78% \n\n69% \n\n78% \n\n69% \n\n79% \n\n74% \n\n81% \n\n(1) 2019 data has been adjusted to reflect changes in scope between business lines.\n\nHeadcount\n\nAt December\xa031, 2020, the total Group headcount is 269,769\xa0employees \ncompared with 219,314\xa0employees one year earlier. This 50,455\xa0net \nincrease (+23.0%) is mainly due to the integration of Altran team \nmembers from April\xa01, 2020 and reflects:\n\n—  97,837\xa0additions; and\n—  47,382\xa0 departures (including 32,928\xa0 resignations), \n\nrepresenting a weighted attrition rate of 12.8% (compared \nwith 20.0% in 2019).\n\nOrder book\n\nBookings totaled €16,892\xa0million in 2020, an increase of +13% at \nconstant exchange rates year-on-year. At 107%, the book‑to‑bill \nratio reflects the strength of commercial activity in the context \nof the pandemic.\n\nOther significant events in 2020\n\nCompany Purpose\n\nIn October\xa02020, Capgemini unveiled its purpose, which now \nforms one of the fundamentals of the Group: “Unleashing human \nenergies through technology for an inclusive and sustainable \nfuture”. The Group’s conviction is that the digital transformation \nand technology must benefit humanity at large. Capgemini intends \nto be a benchmark in terms of its contribution to society, both in its \nown activities and those of its clients, by fighting against exclusion \nand acting for diversity, equal opportunity and the preservation \nof natural resources.\n\nThis purpose was developed in collaboration with its many \nstakeholders, and with the Group’s employees at the heart of the \nprocess. It embodies the Group’s ambition to ensure the development \nof its talents while encouraging a spirit of entrepreneurship and \ncreativity. With more than 600,000\xa0employees or former employees \nover the past decade, the Group also intends to be recognized \nas a school of excellence, whose talents and skills now resonate \nwell beyond the Company. The Group is also convinced that true \ndiversity is an asset that brings new solutions, creates value, and \ngenerates support and enthusiasm on a universal scale.\n\nNew Brand Promise\n\nIn October\xa02020, Capgemini rolled out its ambitious and committed \nnew brand platform for its clients, employees and all of its audiences: \n“Get the future you want”. It reflects the questions of our time, \nwhen global events and the speed of digital transformation are \npushing everyone to question the role that technology can play \nin building an inclusive and sustainable future. The Group is aware \nthat technology is now an indispensable tool for almost all business \nand societal transformations, but that this potential comes with \ngreat responsibilities, and that it must implement a technology \nthat is designed by and for people, that unleashes the energies \nof people and organizations.\n\nThe message conveyed by this new brand promise is aimed both \nat companies and organizations looking for a trusted partner to \naccompany them in their development, and at all those who want to \nwork within a responsible company. It is based on the Group’s sector \nexpertise and its relevance to its customers’ business challenges, \nits wealth of experience in technologies and its passion for women \nand men. It also embodies the Group’s responsible commitment \nto sustainable development.\n\nNew Environmental Ambitions\n\nMore than ever aware of the need to take action on climate \nchange, in July\xa02020 the Group announced its commitment to \nachieving carbon neutrality for its operations no later than 2025 \nand its ambition to be net zero by 2030. These commitments are \nunderpinned by a new set of carbon reduction targets which have \nbeen approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative as being in \nline with the level of action needed to limit the global warming \nto 1.5°C. Capgemini’s previous target, set in 2015, of reducing \ncarbon emissions by 30% per employee by 2030, was achieved by \nJanuary\xa02020, nearly a decade early.\n\nCapgemini also set an objective of reducing the carbon emissions \nof its clients by 10\xa0million carbon metric tons by 2030, over 20\xa0times \nthe Group’s own emissions.\n\nChanges in governance\n\nFollowing the Shareholders’ Meeting of May\xa020, 2020, Mr. Aiman \nEzzat became Chief Executive Officer and Mr. Paul hermelin \nremained Chairman of the Board of Directors. This internal \nmanagement transition process enabled the appointment of an \ninternal manager. It was launched in 2017 at the initiative of Mr. \nPaul hermelin who was Chairman and Chief Executive Oficer at \nthe time. The Group also appointed Mr. Aiman Ezzat as a director \nwith effect from May\xa020, 2020. Mr. Aiman Ezzat, had been Chief \nOperating Oficer of Capgemini since January\xa01, 2018 and a member \nof the Group Executive Board.\n\nIn addition, the Group appointed Ms.\xa0Belen Moscoso del Prado \nas a director from May\xa020, 2020. Ms.\xa0Belen Moscoso del Prado, \na Spanish citizen, has held several positions in innovation and \ntransformation applied to Digital and data strategy over the course \nof her career in international corporations. This appointment is in \nline with the Group’s ambition to further the internationalization \nof the Board of Directors, deepen its sector expertise and enrich \nthe diversity of its profiles.\n\nAcquisitions and divestments\n\nIn addition to the acquisition of Altran Technologies completed \nin April\xa02020, Capgemini also performed a series of targeted \nacquisitions during the year.\n\nThe Group announced in February the acquisition of Purpose, one \nof the world’s leading social impact agencies. With this acquisition \nCapgemini furthers its capacity to support clients to transform \ntheir business models and practices for impact and engage their \nstakeholders in making meaningful contributions to society.\n\n\n\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION \nAnalysis of Capgemini group consolidated results\n\nCAPGEMINI 215\n\n5.\n\nCapgemini also developed its Data and Analytics capabilities \nin Scandinavia with the acquisition of Advectas in February. By \njoining Capgemini’s Insights & Data global business line, the 200+ \nstrong Advectas team has helped to further meet growing client \ndemand for Capgemini’s Business Intelligence and data analytics \nservices across the region.\n\nIn March, the Group announced the acquisition of WhiteSky Labs, \none of the largest independent MuleSoft full-service consultancies in \nthe world, with operations across Australia and Asia. This acquisition \nstrengthens Capgemini’s capability to realize the potential of API \npowered enterprise integration across the region, in order to \nsupport the digital transformation of public and private sector \norganizations.\n\nFinally, in November the Group entered into an agreement to \nacquire the Australian company RXP Services, a Digital services \nconsulting firm listed on the ASX market. This acquisition will \nstrengthen Capgemini’s digital, data and cloud capabilities in \nAustralia, supporting the Group’s strong growth ambition in the \nAsia-Pacific region.\n\nCapgemini also adapted its offering portfolio with the signature \nin September of an agreement with Apax Partners for the sale of \nOdigo, a leader in Contact-Center-as-a-Service (CCaaS) solutions \nprincipally for large companies. This transaction was completed \nin December\xa02020.\n\nChanges in the financial structure\n\nCapgemini performed two multi-tranche bond issues during 2020, \nprimarily in connection with Altran acquisition financing.\n\nIn April\xa02020, the Group performed an initial €3.5\xa0billion bond issue \nfor the bridge loan secured in 2019 to finance the acquisition of \nAltran Technologies, as well as for general corporate purposes. \nThis issue comprises four tranches:\n\n—  a €500\xa0 million tranche maturing in 2\xa0 years (2022 tranche), \npaying a coupon of 1.250%,\n\n—  a €800\xa0 million tranche maturing in 6\xa0 years (2026 tranche), \npaying a coupon of 1.625%,\n\n—  a €1\xa0billion tranche maturing in 9\xa0years (2029 tranche), paying \na coupon of 2.000%, and\n\n—  a €1.2\xa0 billion tranche maturing in 12\xa0 years (2032 tranche), \npaying a coupon of 2.375%.\n\nIn June\xa02020, the Group performed a second €1.6\xa0billion bond issue \nto refinance, at far more favorable conditions, the borrowings \npreviously carried by Altran Technologies. This new bond issue \ncomprises two tranches:\n\n—  a €800\xa0million tranche maturing in 5\xa0years, paying a coupon \nof 0.625%, and\n\n—  a €800\xa0million tranche maturing in 10\xa0years, paying a coupon \nof 1.125%.\n\nIn September\xa02020, the financial rating agency, Standard & Poor’s, \nconfirmed Capgemini’s long-term credit rating of BBB, with a neutral \noutlook, awarded in March\xa02020 in anticipation of the completion \nof the Altran Technologies acquisition.\n\nFinally, the seventh employee share ownership plan (ESOP) launched \nin September\xa02020 and aimed at associating employees with the \nGroup’s development and performance, was a great success with \na subscription rate of 174%. This new plan increases employee \nshare ownership above 6% of the share capital.\n\nCommercial momentum\n\nDespite the impact of the Covid-19 global pandemic on its activities, \nCapgemini enjoyed continued strong demand in 2020 from its \nmajor clients to support their digital transformation across all its \nmain vertical segments:\n\n—  in the Manufacturing and Life Sciences sector:\n\n–  a global pharmaceutical group selected Capgemini \nto help it develop a patient experience platform for a \nnew revolutionary therapy for individuals with serious \nauto-immune disorders; \n\n–  the Group was selected as preferred supplier by a global \nleader in life sciences to support the digitalization of its \noperations, including the implementation of artificial \nintelligence and machine learning solutions; \n\n–  Capgemini signed a contract with a leading German \ncar manufacturer to implement a real time analysis \nand immediate response system for quality issues sent \ndirectly by vehicles to support services; \n\n–  Capgemini was chosen by a German mechanical \nengineering company to digitalize the accounting and \npurchasing system of its worldwide entities and, in \nparticular, prepare them for the implementation of the \nSAP S/4\xa0hANA suite; \n\n–  a global leading manufacturer of domestic appliances \nselected the Group to support the deployment of the S4/\nhANA suite in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region; \n\n–  a global pharmaceutical company has chosen Capgemini \nto help transform its clinical trials into a fully digital \noperation.

This single supplier \ncontract, due to the required combination of expertise \nand capabilities, illustrates the unique value proposal now \noffered by the Group to its clients;\n\n—  Altran’s and Capgemini’s combined intelligent industry \nexpertise will help improve the industrial network of another \nglobal group specializing in energy solutions in several \ncountries. Once again, the new entity’s unique combination \nof expertise and geographical coverage enabled the Group \nto win this contract without a tender process; \n\n—  a major energy player awarded the Group an engineering \nproject to transform one of its industrial sites, due to its \ncapacity to deploy all necessary expertise without forming \na consortium; \n\n—  finally, considering the expertise of Altran in the car industry, \na large European car manufacturer has selected Capgemini to \nprovide the turnkey development program of a light electric \nvehicle designed to meet the environmental challenges.\n\nRewards and recognitions\n\nCapgemini’s technical and sector expertise was recognized by \nseveral prizes and distinctions in 2020, including most notably \nthe following awards:\n\n—  ISG named Capgemini as “Global Market Leader 2019-2020” \nin next-gen Application Development and Maintenance \nservices (January); \n\n—  Everest Group named the Group as a Leader in a large number \nof technology service offerings, such as services for various \ninsurance sectors (January, March and May), Application \nand Digital services for capital markets (February), Advanced \nAnalytics and Insights Services 2020 (February), Finance \nand Accounting Digital Capability Platform Solutions Service \nProviders (March), Intelligent Automation in Business \nProcesses Solution Providers 2020 (May), Open Banking IT \nServices (June) and IT Guidewire services (July); \n\n—  Capgemini was positioned as a Leader by Gartner in its Magic \nQuadrant for Data and Analytics Service Providers (March), \nfollowed by CRM and Customer Experience Implementation \nServices (April), Public Cloud Infrastructure Professional and \nManaged Services, Worldwide (May), Managed Workplace \nServices, Europe (May) and IT Services for Communications \nService Providers, Worldwide (September); \n\n—  the Group was named as a Leader by Nelsonhall in its NEAT \nevaluation of learning services (April), in Digital Banking \n(June), in Cloud‑Based HR Transformation (October) and in \nAdvanced Digital Workplace Services (November); \n\n—  Capgemini was also named a Leader by IDC for SAP \nimplementation services (August) and a leading supplier \nof RPA (Robotic Process Automation) services to financial \ninstitutions (November); \n\n—  the Group received the first Commerce Cloud Partner \nTrailblazer Award for B2C at the 2019 Salesforce Lightning \nBolt Trailblazer Awards (January); \n\n—  Capgemini scooped Frost & Sullivan’s 2019 Global Company \nof the year award for Software Testing solutions (June); \n\n—  Capgemini was honored by AI Breakthrough for the second \nyear running for its innovation in artificial intelligence at the \n2020 AI Breakthrough Awards (September).\n\n\n\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION \nAnalysis of Capgemini group consolidated results\n\nCAPGEMINI 217\n\n5.\n\nFinally, Capgemini was recognized in 2020 as One of the World’s Most \nEthical Companies by the Ethisphere Institute, for the eighth year in \na row. The Group also saw its local initiatives in terms of Corporate \nSocial Responsibility being recognized by various recognitions in \nmany countries, as illustrated by the selected examples below:\n\n—  the exemplary work done in India on Digital Academies has \nwon us the Indian Chamber of Commerce Award in the \n“Employment Enhancing Vocational Skills” category; \n\n—  our Digital Academy efforts in the UK with ‘Code your Future’, \ntargeting refugees, migrants and young people coming \n\nfrom disadvantaged areas, were recognized by the “best \nEducation Project” prize in the 2020 Global Good Awards; \n\n—  Capgemini India received the “Best companies for women” and \n“Most inclusive companies” awards by AVTAR Group & Working \nMother Media; \n\n—  in North America Capgemini was designated a 2020 Top \nCompanies for Executive Women by Working Mother Media, \nand one of the “best Places to Work” by hRC, with a 100% \nscore in Corporate Equality Index.\n\n5.1.2  Comments on the Capgemini group consolidated financial statements \nand outlook for 2021\n\nConsolidated Income Statement\n\nConsolidated revenues total €15,848\xa0million for the year ended \nDecember\xa031, 2020, compared with €14,125\xa0million in 2019, up \n12.2% on reported figures and 13.7% at constant exchange rates.\n\nOperating expenses total €13,969\xa0 million, compared with \n€12,384\xa0million in 2019.\n\nAn analysis of costs by nature highlights a €1,560\xa0million increase \nin personnel costs from €8,918\xa0million in 2019 to €10,478\xa0million \nin 2020. Personnel costs represent 66.1% of revenues compared \nwith 63.1% in 2019. The average headcount rose 16.4% in 2020 \nto 251,525, compared with 216,104 in 2019. Offshore employees \nrepresent 54% of the total Group headcount in 2020.\n\nAn analysis of costs by function reveals:\n\n—  the cost of services rendered is €11,712\xa0million, or 73.9% of \nrevenues, up 1.2\xa0points on 2019. The gross margin is 26.1% of \nrevenues in 2020, compared with 27.3% in 2019; \n\n—  selling costs total €1,113\xa0million, or 7.0% of revenues; \n\n—  general and administrative expenses total €1,144\xa0 million \n(7.2% of revenues).\n\nThe operating margin is therefore €1,879\xa0million in 2020, compared \nwith €1,741\xa0million in 2019, representing a margin rate of 11.9% \n(12.3% in 2019).\n\nOther operating income and expense is a net expense of \n€377\xa0million in 2020, compared with €308\xa0million in 2019. This \nsignificant increase is mainly due to:\n\n—  the integration of Altran from April\xa01, 2020 and in particular: \nthe amortization of intangible assets recognized on the \nbusiness combination, as well as acquisition and integration \ncosts relating to this acquisition and, finally, the inclusion of \nrestructuring expenses specific to Altran; partially offset by\n\n—  the capital gain realized on the sale of the Odigo business on \nDecember\xa030, 2020.\n\nOperating profit is €1,502\xa0million (9.5% of revenues), compared \nwith €1,433\xa0million in 2019 (10.1% of revenues).\n\nThe net financial expense is €147\xa0million, compared with €79\xa0million \nin 2019. This increase is mainly due to the cost of financing the \nAltran acquisition.\n\nThe income tax expense is €400\xa0million, compared with €502\xa0million \nin 2019. The effective tax rate is 29.5% in 2020, compared with \n37.1% in 2019. Excluding the tax income relating to the transitional \nimpact of the 2017 US tax reform of €8\xa0million in 2020 and the tax \nexpense of €60\xa0million in 2019, the effective tax rate fell from \n32.6% in 2019 to 30.1% in 2020. This decrease is mainly due to the \n\nimpact of permanent differences – especially the untaxed capital \ngain net of costs on the sale of Odigo – partially offset by the \nnon-recognition of tax losses carried forward of the fiscal year due \nto uncertainties relating to the global health crisis. Excluding the \ntax income relating to the transitional impact of the 2017 US tax \nreform of €8\xa0million and the capital gain on Odigo disposal, the \nadjusted effective tax rate for 2020 would be 33%.\n\nProfit for the year attributable to owners of the Company is \n€957\xa0million in 2020, compared with €856\xa0million in 2019. Excluding \nthe tax income of €8\xa0million due to the transitional impact of the \n2017 US tax reform, normalized earnings per share is therefore \n€7.23\xa0 based on an average of 167,620,101\xa0 ordinary shares \noutstanding in 2020, compared with €6.76\xa0based on an average \nof 166,171,198\xa0ordinary shares outstanding in 2019.\n\nConsolidated Statement of Financial Position\n\nEquity attributable to owners of the Company totaled €6,103\xa0million \nat December\xa031, 2020, down €2,321\xa0million on December\xa031, 2019. \nThe decrease was mainly due to:\n\n—  the impact of the subsequent acquisition of Altran shares \nafter the initial takeover for €2,135\xa0million; \n\n— t he negative impact of other comprehensive income of \n€752\xa0million; \n\n—  the elimination of treasury shares in the amount of \n€518\xa0million; \n\n— t he payment to shareholders of dividends of €226\xa0 million, \ncompensated by:\n\n–  the impact of incentive and employee share ownership \ninstruments of €387\xa0 million, including €278\xa0 million in \nrespect of the share capital increase under the ESOP \n2020 international employee share ownership plan; \n\n–  the net profit for the period of €957\xa0million.\n\nNon‑current assets totaled €14,115\xa0million at December\xa031, 2020, \nup €2,543\xa0million on December\xa031, 2019. This rise was mainly \nattributable to the recognition of goodwill of €2,578\xa0million on \nthe takeover of the Altran Technologies group in 2020.\n\nNon‑current liabilities totaled €9,864\xa0million at December\xa031, \n2020, up €5,268\xa0million on December\xa031, 2019. This increase is \nmainly due to the various bond issues performed in the context \nof acquiring the Altran Technologies group.\n\nTrade receivables and contract assets totaled €3,938\xa0million at \nDecember\xa031, 2020, compared with €3,380\xa0million at December\xa031, \n2019. Trade receivables and contract assets excluding contract costs \nand net of contract liabilities totaled €2,792\xa0million at December\xa031, \n2020, compared with €2,461\xa0million at December\xa031, 2019.\n\n\n\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION \nAnalysis of Capgemini group consolidated results\n\n218 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n5.\n\nAccounts and notes payable mainly consist of trade payables \nand related accounts, personnel costs and accrued taxes other \nthan income tax and total €3,358\xa0million at December\xa031, 2020, \ncompared with €3,011\xa0million at December\xa031, 2019.\n\nConsolidated net debt totaled €4,904\xa0million at December\xa031, \n2020, compared with €600\xa0million at December\xa031, 2019. This \n€4,304\xa0million increase in net debt on December\xa031, 2019 chiefly \nreflects:\n\n—  cash outflows in respect of the acquisition of Altran shares \n(including the additional consideration granted on the shares \npurchased in 2019) of €3,280\xa0million, plus Altran net debt of \n€1,556\xa0million,\n\n—  the payment to shareholders of the 2019 dividend of \n€226\xa0million; \n\n—  net cash outflows of €514\xa0million in respect of transactions in \nCapgemini\xa0SE shares; \n\npartially offset by the generation of organic free cash flow in 2020 \nof €1,119\xa0million, the share capital increase under the ESOP 2020 \ninternational employee share ownership plan for €278\xa0million and \nthe sale of the Odigo business on December\xa030, 2020.\n\nOutlook for 2021\n\nWhile the environment tends to improve, the Group remains vigilant \non the evolution of the health situation.\n\nIn an improving but still uncertain environment, the Group targets \nfor 2021:\n\n—  A constant currency growth of +7.0% to +9.0%; \n—  An operating margin of 12.2% to 12.4%, i.e. at 2019 level; \n—  An organic free cash flow above €1,300\xa0million.\n\nThe inorganic contribution to growth is anticipated at c. 4.5\xa0points.\n\n\n\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION \nConsolidated accounts\n\nCAPGEMINI 219\n\n5.\n\n5.2  Consolidated accounts\n\n5.2.1  Consolidated Income Statement\n\n 2019   2020

\n\n\n\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION \nConsolidated accounts\n\n226 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n5.\n\nNote 1   Accounting basis\n\nThe consolidated financial statements for the year ended December\xa031, \n2020 of Capgemini\xa0SE, a European company headquartered at \n11\xa0rue de Tilsitt, 75017, Paris, and the notes thereto were adopted \nby the Board of Directors on February\xa017, 2021. The consolidated \nfinancial statements will be approved by the Shareholders’ Meeting, \nscheduled for May\xa020, 2021.\n\nA)  IFRS standards base\n\nPursuant to European Commission Regulation no. 1606-2002 of \nJuly\xa019, 2002, the 2020 consolidated financial statements have been \nprepared in accordance with international accounting standards \n(IFRS, International Financial Reporting Standards) as issued by the \nInternational Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and endorsed by \nthe European Union (EU).\n\nThe Group, a global leader in consulting, digital transformation, \ntechnology, and Engineering Services, also takes account of \nthe positions adopted by Syntec Numérique, an organization \nrepresenting major consulting and computer services companies \nin France, regarding the application of certain IFRS.\n\nThe main accounting policies are presented at the beginning of \neach note to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nB)  New standards and interpretations applicable in \n2020\n\na)  New standards, amendments and interpretations of \nmandatory effect at January 1, 2020\n\nThe accounting policies applied by the Capgemini group are unchanged \non those applied for the preparation of the December\xa031, 2019 \nconsolidated financial statements. The standards, amendments, \nand interpretations which entered into mandatory effect on \nJanuary\xa01, 2020 did not have a material impact on the Group \nfinancial statements.\n\nb)  Other new standards not yet in effect at January 1, 2020 \nand not adopted early\n\nThe Group did not adopt early any new standards not yet in effect \nat January\xa01, 2020.\n\nC)  Use of estimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements involves the \nuse of estimates and assumptions which may have an impact on \nthe reported values of assets and liabilities at the period end or \non certain items of either net profit or the income and expenses \nrecognized directly in equity for the year. Estimates are based on \neconomic data and assumptions which are likely to vary over time \nand interpretations of local regulation when necessary. They have \nnotably been made in an economic and health context that remains \nuncertain, due to the global Covid-19 pandemic. These estimates \nare subject to a degree of uncertainty and mainly concern revenue \nrecognition on a percentage-of-completion basis, provisions, \nmeasurement of the amount of intangible assets and deferred \ntax assets, provisions for pensions and other post-employment \nbenefits, the fair value of derivatives and the calculation of the \ntax expense, notably in the context of the US tax reform.\n\n\n\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION \nConsolidated accounts\n\nCAPGEMINI 227\n\n5.\n\nNote 2 Consolidation principles and Group structure\n\nConsolidation methods\n\nThe accounts of companies directly or indirectly controlled by the \nparent company are fully consolidated. The parent company is \ndeemed to exercise control over an entity when it has the power \nto govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as \nto obtain benefits from its activities.\n\nInvestments in associates over whose management the parent \ncompany directly or indirectly exercises significant influence, \nwithout however exercising full or joint control, are accounted \nfor by the equity method. This method consists of recording the \nGroup’s share in profit for the year of the associate in the Income \nStatement. The Group’s share in net assets of the associate is \nrecorded under “other non-current assets” in the Consolidated \nStatement of Financial Position.\n\nDetails of the scope of consolidation are provided in Note\xa033 – List \nof the main consolidated companies by country.\n\nAll consolidated companies prepared their accounts to December\xa031, \n2020 in accordance with the accounting policies adopted by the \nGroup.\n\nInter-company transactions are eliminated on consolidation, a\nwell as inter-company profits.\n\ns \n\nForeign currency translation\n\nThe consolidated accounts presented in these consolidated financial \nstatements have been prepared in euros.\n\nThe Consolidated Statements of Financial Position of subsidiaries \ndenominated in foreign currencies are translated into euros at \nyear-end rates of exchange with the exception of equity accounts, \nwhich are carried at their historical values. Income statements \ndenominated in foreign currencies are translated into euros at \nthe average rates of exchange for the year. however, for certain \nmaterial transactions, it may be relevant to use a specific rate of \nexchange. Differences arising from translation at these different \nrates are recognized directly in equity under “Translation reserves” \nand have no impact on the Income Statement.\n\nExchange differences arising on monetary items which form an \nintegral part of the net investment in foreign subsidiaries are \nrecognized in equity.\n\nExchange differences on receivables and payables denominated in \na foreign currency are recorded in operating profit or net financial \nexpense, depending on the type of transaction concerned.\n\nThe exchange rates used to translate the financial statements of \nthe Group’s main subsidiaries into euros are as follows:\n\n  Average rate Closing rate\n\n2019 2020 2019 2020 \n\nAustralian dollar 0.62096 0.60456 0.62520 0.62909 \n\nBrazilian real 0.22676 0.17203 0.22145 0.15690 \n\nCanadian dollar 0.67321 0.65425 0.68503 0.63967 \n\nChinese renminbi yuan 0.12932 0.12711 0.12787 0.12465 \n\nIndian rupee 0.01268 0.01184 0.01247 0.01115 \n\nNorwegian krone 0.10156 0.09337 0.10138 0.09551 \n\nPolish zloty 0.23270 0.22516 0.23492 0.21931 \n\nPound sterling 1.14039 1.12528 1.17536 1.11231 \n\nSwedish krona 0.09448 0.09539 0.09572 0.09966 \n\nUS dollar 0.89329 0.87748 0.89016 0.81493 \n\n  \n\nBusiness combinations\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition \nmethod. Under this method, the identifiable assets acquired and \nliabilities assumed are recognized at fair value at the acquisition \ndate and may be adjusted during the 12\xa0months following this date.\n\nExchange gains and losses on inter-company \ntransactions\n\nThe results and financial position of a foreign subsidiary are included \nin the Group’s consolidated financial statements after the elimination \nof inter-company balances and transactions. however, a foreign \nexchange gain or loss arising on an inter-company monetary asset \nor liability (e.g. an inter-company receivable denominated in a \ncurrency different from the functional currency of the subsidiary) \ncannot be eliminated. Such foreign exchange gains and losses are \nrecognized in the Income Statement or in Income and expense \nrecognized directly in equity, if the underlying forms an integral \npart of the net investment in the foreign operation (e.g. a loan \nwith no fixed maturity).\n\nThe fair values of hedging instruments relating to inter-company \noperating transactions performed as part of the centralized\nmanagement of currency risk in the parent company are eliminated.\n\n \n\nA)  Acquisition of the Altran Technologies group\n\nDescription of the transaction\n\nOn June\xa024, 2019, Capgemini\xa0SE and Altran Technologies S.A. (from \nnow on Altran Technologies S.A.S., “Altran”), the global leader in \nEngineering and R&D services, jointly announced the proposed \nacquisition of Altran by Capgemini, through a friendly tender \noffer at €14.00\xa0per Altran share, payable in cash. This acquisition \nwas unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both \ncompanies and seeks to create a global digital transformation \nleader for industrial and tech companies. On July\xa02, 2019, following \nsettlement and delivery of the off-market acquisition of a block of \nshares from shareholders led by Apax Partners and in accordance \nwith the announcement of June\xa024, 2019, the Group acquired \n29,378,319\xa0Altran shares representing 11.43% of Altran’s share capital.\n\nCapgemini filed its draft offer and the related offer document with \nthe French Financial Markets Authority (AMF) on September\xa023, \n2019. On October\xa014, 2019, the AMF issued its clearance on the \ndraft offer and approved Capgemini’s offer document (AMF visa \nno. 19-489) and Altran’s response document (AMF visa no. 19-490).\n\nOn January\xa014, 2020, Capgemini increased the offer price from \n€14.00\xa0to €14.50\xa0per share.\n\nFollowing settlement and delivery on February\xa04 and 21, 2020, \nrespectively, Capgemini held 54.17% of the share capital and at \nleast 54.04% of voting rights. Taking into account the shares owned \nby Altran, Capgemini held 55.13% of Altran’s share capital and at \nleast 55.00% of voting rights.\n\n\n\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION \nConsolidated accounts\n\n228 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n5.\n\nOn March\xa013, 2020, the Paris Appeal Court issued a ruling rejecting \nthe action brought by certain minority shareholders of Altran to \nannul the AMF’s clearance decision on Capgemini’s friendly tender \noffer for Altran Technologies shares. The Appeal Court confirmed \nthe validity of the offer with respect to applicable legislative \nand regulatory provisions and of the visa issued by the AMF on \nAltran’s response document. Accordingly, the takeover of Altran \nby Capgemini, which held 55.13% of the Altran share capital and \nat least 55.00% of voting rights at this date, came into effect at \nMarch\xa013, 2020. As a practical expedient, Altran Technologies \ngroup is fully integrated in the Capgemini’s consolidation scope \nfrom April\xa01, 2020.\n\nThe offer was reopened between March\xa016 and 27, 2020 (inclusive), \nunder the same financial terms and conditions, enabling shareholders \nthat had not yet contributed their shares to the offer to do so.\n\nOn April\xa01, 2020, the AMF announced that 110,571,163\xa0Altran shares \nwere tendered following the new reopening of Capgemini’s offer. \nFollowing settlement and delivery on April\xa08, 2020, Capgemini held \n98.15% of the share capital and at least 98.03% of Altran voting \nrights. This new reopening was recognized in the Group’s accounts \nas a subsequent acquisition of non-controlling interests.\n\nCapgemini then implemented a squeeze-out on the remaining \nAltran shares not yet held after the closure of its offer. Following \nthis procedure, Capgemini now holds the entire share capital and \nvoting rights of Altran and the Altran Technologies shares were \ndelisted after the market close on April\xa015, 2020. This last operation \nwas also recognized in the Group’s accounts as a subsequent \nacquisition of non-controlling interests.\n\nAccounting recognition of the transaction\n\nWithin the context described above, the Group recognized \nprovisional goodwill in respect of this transaction in accordance \nwith the partial goodwill method.\n\na) I nitial takeover: provisional allocation of the purchase price\n\nThe provisional allocation of the purchase price, based on a 55% \nowned interest, is as follows. If, in the year following the acquisition \ndate, new information comes to light regarding the facts and \ncircumstances at the acquisition date leading to an adjustment \nto the amounts below, the recognition of the acquisition will be \nadjusted accordingly.\n\n(in millions of euros) \n\nFair value of previously-held investment (1)  426 \n\nAcquisition of a controlling interest on March\xa013, 2020 1,593 \n\nCash consideration paid at initial takeover 2,019 \n\nNon-controlling interest (2)  (463) \n\nTOTAL CONSIDERATION TRANSFERRED (A) 1,556 \n\n(in millions of euros) \n\nIntangible assets 668 \n\no/w customer relationships 503 \n\nProperty, plant and equipment 140 \n\nOther non-current and current assets 354 \n\nCash and cash equivalents 175 \n\nShort- and long-term borrowings and bank overdrafts (1,731) \n\nCurrent and non-current provisions (341) \n\nDeferred taxes, net 23 \n\no/w deferred tax liabilities relating to the allocation of the purchase price (129) \n\nOther non-current and current liabilities (202) \n\nOther assets and liabilities (108) \n\nPROVISIONAL NET ASSETS AT DATE OF INITIAL TAKEOVER (B) (1,022) \n\nPROVISIONAL GOODWILL (A)-(B) 2,578 \n\n  \n\n  \n\n(1) As all shares were purchased at a price of €14.50, the fair value of the previously-held investment is equal to the net carrying amount of the share block (29,378,319\xa0shares) \npurchased off-market from shareholders led by Apax Partners on July\xa02, 2019.\n\n(2) This amount corresponds to the minority share (45% of provisional net assets) at the date of initial takeover.\n\nThe fair value remeasurement of the assets and liabilities and the \npurchase price allocation pursuant to IFRS\xa03\xa0were assessed by an \nindependent expert. The measurement of the assets transferred \nand liabilities assumed led in particular to the recognition of \nan intangible asset in respect of customer relationships in the \namount of €503\xa0million, amortized on a straight line basis over \na useful life of 10\xa0years. This intangible asset was valued by the \nindependent expert by discounting expected future operating cash \nflow projections (excess profits method). In addition, the Group \nperformed, with his councils, a review of tax, social and legal risks \nto which the Group is potentially exposed, based on the available \ninformation and ongoing procedures.\n\nThe goodwill and Customer Relationship intangible asset were \nallocated to the various Group cash-generating units that will \nbenefit from this acquisition.\n\nSince its acquisition on April\xa0 1, 2020, Altran has contributed \n€2,141\xa0million and €205\xa0million, respectively, to Group revenues and \noperating margin and is presented in the Group’s five geographic \nareas for segment reporting purposes. It should be noted that as \nAltran’s integration within the group began in the second quarter \nof 2020, this information is not anymore representative of the \nstand-alone Altran’s performance.\n\n\n\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION \nConsolidated accounts\n\nCAPGEMINI 229\n\n5.\n\nAcquisition costs relating to the transaction totaled €35\xa0million \nin 2020.\n\nb)  Subsequent acquisition of non‑controlling interests in \nAltran Technologies\n\nFollowing settlement and delivery on April\xa08, 2020 and the delisting \nof Altran shares after the market close on April\xa015, 2020, Capgemini \nacquired the remaining 45% interest.\n\nThis subsequent acquisition of non-controlling interests was \ntherefore recognized as a reduction in Group equity of €2,135\xa0million, \ncorresponding to the purchase of the remaining 115,320,381\xa0shares \nfor €1,672\xa0million and the value of non-controlling interests at the \ninitial takeover (see above) of €463\xa0million.\n\nTransaction financing\n\na)  Deal financing\n\nTo finance this acquisition, the Group used available cash and \nnotably performed the following transactions:\n\n—  negotiation on June\xa0 24, 2019 of a €5.4\xa0 billion bridge loan \ncovering the purchase of securities and Altran’s gross \ndebt, with an initial term of one year and two consecutive \nsix-month extension options exercisable at Capgemini’s \ninitiative. Following a partial cancellation, the bridge loan \ntotaled €4.4\xa0billion and was available in full at December\xa031, \n2019;\n\n—  on April\xa08, 2020 Capgemini priced a four-tranche bond issue \nwith a total nominal value of €3.5\xa0 billion and settlement/\ndelivery on April\xa015, 2020. The main terms of this issue’s four \ntranches are as follows:\n\n–  €500\xa0 million 2-year notes (the 2022 tranche), with a \ncoupon of 1.250% (issue price 99.794%),\n\n–  €800\xa0 million 6-year notes (the 2026 tranche), with a \ncoupon of 1.625% (issue price 99.412%),\n\n– € 1\xa0billion 9-year notes (the 2029 tranche), with a coupon \nof 2.000% (issue price 99.163%), and\n\n–  €1.2\xa0 billion 12-year notes (the 2032 tranche), with a \ncoupon of 2.375% (issue price 99.003%).\n\nThe proceeds of this bond issue were primarily used to repay the \nbridge loan secured for the acquisition of Altran Technologies \nand to redeem the €676\xa0million principal amount outstanding \nunder the bonds maturing on July\xa01, 2020.\n\n—  on June\xa016, 2020 Capgemini priced a dual-tranche bond issue \nwith a total nominal value of €1.6\xa0 billion and settlement/\ndelivery on June\xa023, 2020. The main terms of this issue’s two \ntranches are as follows:\n\n–  €800\xa0 million 5-year notes (the 2025 tranche), with a \ncoupon of 0.625% (issue price 99.887%),\n\n–  €800\xa0 million 10-year notes (the 2030 tranche), with a \ncoupon of 1.125% (issue price 99.521%),\n\nThe proceeds of this bond issue were primarily used to repay \nAltran Technologies’ Term Loan B and a bank loan secured by \nAltran in March\xa02020 (following the exercise by certain Term \nLoan B lenders of their early repayment rights following \nthe acquisition of Altran Technologies by Capgemini), both \nmaturing in March\xa02025 and with a total outstanding principal \nof €1.6\xa0billion at the repayment date (the “Term Loans”).\n\nAt December\xa031, 2020, the bridge loan secured to finance the \nacquisition of Altran, the Term Loans and a €250\xa0million revolving \ncredit facility set-up by Altran Technologies and not drawn, were \nrepaid in full and canceled.\n\nb)  Impact on the Statement of Cash Flows\n\nThe transaction impacted the Statement of Cash Flows as follows:\n\nhad the acquisition taken place on January\xa01, 2020 and based on \ninformation provided by Altran for the first quarter of 2020, the \nGroup estimates that the combined revenues would have been \n€16,663\xa0million.\n\n(in millions of euros) 2019 2020 \n\nCash outflows in respect of the acquisition of Altran Technologies shares (1) (2)  (413) (15) \n\nCash (outflows) inflows on business combinations net of cash  \nand cash equivalents acquired (165) (1,557) \n\no/w: Takeover of Altran Technologies (2)  ‑ (1,593) \n\no/w: Altran Technologies cash and cash equivalents net of overdrafts at date of acquisition of control ‑ 155 \n\nProceeds from borrowings 430 9,308 \n\no/w: Bridge loan 400 3,055 \n\no/w: April and June 2020 bond issues ‑ 5,045 \n\nRepayment of borrowings (448) (6,273) \n\no/w: Redemption of drawings on bridge loan (400) (3,055) \n\no/w: Redemption of the Altran Technologies Term Loans ‑ (1,592) \n\no/w: Early redemption of bond maturing in July 2020 ‑ (676) \n\nSubsequent acquisition of Altran Technologies securities - (1,672) \n\n(1) Including financial transaction taxes totaling €2\xa0million in 2019 and the increase from €14\xa0to €14.50\xa0per share for the 11.43% share block purchased on July\xa02, 2019 for \n€15\xa0million.\n\n(2) The cash consideration paid at initial takeover of €2,019\xa0million corresponds to the cash outflows in respect of the acquisition of Altran shares in 2019 and the first-half of \n2020 of respectively €411\xa0million and €15\xa0million as well as the cash outflow linked to the takeover date of March\xa013, 2020 of €1,593\xa0million.\n\nEmployee incentive instruments\n\nAltran Technologies set up several Free Share grant plans between \n2017 and 2019, with vesting periods still running at the takeover date.\n\nCapgemini group undertook to modify the terms and conditions \nof the 2017 plan (the “2017 Plan”), the 2018 plan (the “2018 \n\nPlan”) and the 2019 plan (the “2019 Plan”) to lift the condition of \npresence in the event of dismissal (except for gross negligence or \nserious misconduct) and in the event of a substantial change to \nthe employment contract resulting in its termination due to the \nactions of the employer (constructive dismissal ).\n\n\n\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION \nConsolidated accounts\n\n230 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n5.\n\nCapgemini group also undertook, within one month of the \nsettlement-delivery of the Offer, to propose to each of the beneficiaries \nof Free Shares to waive their rights to receive such Free Shares in \nexchange for the payment by Capgemini of cash compensation in \naccordance with the terms below (the “Compensation Mechanism”). \nThe beneficiaries may only accept the Compensation Mechanism \nduring a three-month period commencing the settlement-delivery \ndate of the Offer and will only benefit from it, as the case may be, \nat the end of the applicable vesting period for each plan.\n\nNo later than fifteen working days following expiry of the vesting \nperiod provided by the 2017 Plan, the 2018 Plan and the 2019 Plan, \nrespectively, the Company undertakes:\n\n—  with respect to the 2017 Plan, subject to the satisfaction \nof the presence condition (amended as detailed above) at \nthe end of the vesting period (the “2017 Eligible Rights”), \nto apply the performance conditions provided under the \n2017 Plan for fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019 to all the 2017 \nEligible Rights; \n\n—  with respect to the 2018 Plan, subject to the satisfaction \nof the presence condition (amended as detailed above) at \nthe end of the vesting period (the “2018 Eligible Rights”), \nto apply the performance conditions as provided under the \n2018 Plan for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 to two-thirds of \nthe 2018 Eligible Rights, and not to apply the performance \nconditions for fiscal year 2020 for the remaining third of the \n2018 Eligible Rights (which would therefore vest in full); and\n\n—  with respect to the 2019 Plan, subject to the satisfaction \nof the presence condition (amended as detailed above) at \nthe end of the vesting period (the “2019 Eligible Rights”), \nto apply the performance conditions as provided under \nthe 2019 Plan for fiscal year 2019 to one-third of the 2019 \nEligible Rights, and not to apply the performance conditions \n\nfor fiscal years 2020 and 2021 for the remaining two-thirds of \nthe 2019 Eligible Rights (which would therefore vest in full).\n\nFor each beneficiary having accepted the Compensation Mechanism, \nthe Company will pay, no later than the forty-fifth working day \nfollowing the end of the applicable vesting period provided under \nthe 2017 Plan, the 2018 Plan and the 2019 Plan, a gross cash amount \nequal, for each right to receive Free Shares, to the Offer price (i.e. \n€14.50\xa0per share) indexed to the change in the Capgemini share \nprice between the settlement-delivery date of the Offer and the \nend of the relevant vesting period. This change cannot exceed \n+20% or be lower than (-20%).\n\nThe total estimated expense (including related social security \ncontributions) of €31.2\xa0million for instruments in the course of \nvesting is allocated between the different grant dates and the \ndifferent vesting dates. A provision of €15.4\xa0million was therefore \nrecognized in the opening balance sheet for the period, covering \nservices rendered between the grant date and the Altran acquisition \ndate. The estimated expense of €15.8\xa0million for the period after \nthe acquisition date will be taken to profit or loss progressively, \nas integration costs for companies acquired included in “Other \noperating income and expense”, over the period from April\xa01, 2020 \nto the different vesting dates for the relevant rights. An expense \nof €8.8\xa0million was recognized in respect of 2020.\n\nB)  Other changes in the consolidation scope in 2020\n\nDuring 2020 year, the group acquired the companies Purpose, \nAdvectas, WhiteSky Labs, representing around 450\xa0people. The \ncontribution of these acquisitions to Group financial indicators in \n2020 is not material.\n\nOn December\xa030th,2020, the Group sold Odigo, leader in Contact-\nCenter-as-a-Service (CCaaS) solutions principally for large companies, \nto Apax Partners (see Note\xa08 – Other operating income and expense).\n\nNote 3  Alternative performance measures\n\nThe alternative performance measures monitored by the Group \nare defined as follows:\n\n—  organic growth, or like-for-like growth, in revenues is \nthe growth rate calculated at constant Group scope and \nexchange rates. The Group scope and exchange rates used \nare those for the reported period; \n\n—  growth at constant exchange rates in revenues is the\ngrowth rate calculated at exchange rates used for the \nreported period; \n\n—  operating margin is equal to revenues less operating \nexpenses. It is calculated before “Other operating income \nand expense” which include amortization of intangible assets \nrecognized in business combinations, the charge resulting \nfrom the deferred recognition of the fair value of shares \ngranted to employees (including social security contributions \nand employer contributions), and non-recurring revenues \nand expenses, notably impairment of goodwill, negative \ngoodwill, capital gains or losses on disposals of consolidated \ncompanies or businesses, restructuring costs incurred under \na detailed formal plan approved by the Group’s management, \nthe cost of acquiring and integrating companies acquired \nby the Group, including earn-outs comprising conditions of \npresence, and the effects of curtailments, settlements and \ntransfers of defined benefit pension plans;\n\n \n\n—  normalized earnings per share are calculated by dividing \nnormalized profit or loss attributable to owners of the \nCompany by the weighted average number of ordinary \nshares outstanding during the period, excluding treasury \nshares. Normalized net profit or loss is equal to profit for the \nyear attributable to owners of the Company corrected for \nthe impact of items recognized in “Other operating income \nand expense” (see Note\xa0 8 – Other operating income and \nexpense), net of tax calculated using the effective tax rate; \n\n—  net debt (or net cash and cash equivalents) comprises (i)\xa0cash \nand cash equivalents, as presented in the Consolidated \nStatement of Cash Flows (consisting of short-term \ninvestments and cash at bank) less bank overdrafts, (ii)\xa0cash \nmanagement assets (assets presented separately in the \nConsolidated Statement of Financial Position due to their \ncharacteristics), less (iii)\xa0 short- and long-term borrowings. \nAccount is also taken of the impact of hedging instruments \nwhen these relate to borrowings and own shares. Lease \nliabilities (including finance lease liabilities) are excluded \nfrom net debt from January\xa01, 2019; \n\n—  organic free cash flow calculated based on items in \nthe Statement of Cash Flows is equal to cash flow from \noperations less acquisitions of property, plant, equipment \nand intangible assets (net of disposals) and repayments of \nlease liabilities and adjusted for flows relating to the net \ninterest cost.\n\n\n\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION \nConsolidated accounts\n\nCAPGEMINI 231\n\n5.\n\nThe impact of the health crisis on the 2020 consolidated financial\nstatements is not isolated. The definition of the above alternative \nperformance measures is therefore unchanged and, in accordance\nwith past practice, the 2020 consolidated financial statements\n\n \n\n \n \n\ninclude in other operating income and expense a non-material \namount of incremental and non-recurring costs related to this \ncrisis (see Note\xa08 – Other operating income and expense).\n\nNote 4  Operating segments\n\nGroup Management analyzes and measures activity performance \nin the geographic areas where the Group is present.\n\nThe geographic analysis enables management to monitor the \nperformance:\n\n—  of commercial development: it focuses on trends in\nmajor contracts and clients in Group markets across all its \nbusinesses. This monitoring seeks to coordinate the service \noffering of the different businesses in the countries, given \ntheir considerable interaction and to measure the services \nrendered; \n\n—  at operational and financial level: management of treasury \nand support services, the operating investment and \nfinancing policies and the acquisition policy are decided and \nimplemented by geographic area.\n\n \n\nAccordingly, the Group presents segment reporting for the five \ngeographic areas where it is located.\n\nCosts relating to operations and incurred by Group holding \ncompanies on behalf of geographic areas are allocated to the \nrelevant segments either directly or on the basis of an allocation \nkey. Items not allocated correspond to headquarter expenses.\n\nInter-segment transactions are carried out on an arm’s length basis.\n\nThe performance of operating segments is measured based on the \noperating margin*. This indicator enables the measurement and \ncomparison of the operating performance of operating segments, \nirrespective of whether their business results from internal or \nexternal growth.\n\nThe operating margin* realized by the main offshore delivery \ncenters (India and Poland) is reallocated to the geographic areas \nmanaging the contracts to enable a better understanding of the \nperformance of these areas.\n\n* Operating margin, an alternative performance measure monitored by the \nGroup, is defined in Note\xa03 – Alternative performance measures.\n\nThe Group communicates segment information for five geographic areas: North America, France, United Kingdom and Ireland, the Rest \nof Europe, Asia-Pacific and Latin America.\n\n2020 (in millions of euros) \nNorth \n\nAmerica France\n\nUnited \nKingdom \n\nand  \nIreland\n\nRest of \nEurope\n\nAsia-Pacific \nand Latin \n\nAmerica\nHQ  \n\nexpenses\nElimina‑ \n\ntions Total \n\nRevenues\n\n external 4,839 3,443 1,741 4,700 1,125 - - 15,848 \n\n inter-geographic area 161 306 215 363 1,721 - (2,766) - \n\nTOTAL REVENUES 5,000 3,749 1,956 5,063 2,846 - (2,766) 15,848 \n\nOPERATING MARGIN (1)  718 300 269 537 146 (91) - 1,879 \n\n% of revenues 14.8 8.7 15.5 11.4 13.0 ‑ ‑ 11.9 \n\nOPERATING PROFIT 589 297 238 419 85 (126) - 1,502 \n\n        \n\n —\n\n —\n\n(1) Operating margin, an alternative performance measure monitored by the Group, is defined in Note\xa03 – Alternative performance measures.\n\nUnited \nKingdom \n\nand  \nIreland\n\nAsia-Pacific \nand Latin \n\nAmerica\nNorth \n\nAmerica\nRest of \nEurope\n\nHQ \nexpenses\n\nElimina‑ \ntions2019 (in millions of euros) France Total \n\nRevenues\n\n external 4,567 3,017 1,653 3,809 1,079 - - 14,125 \n\n inter-geographic area 135 257 190 340 1,645 - (2,567) - \n\nTOTAL REVENUES 4,702 3,274 1,843 4,149 2,724 - (2,567) 14,125 \n\nOPERATING MARGIN (1)  637 366 251 451 120 (84) - 1,741 \n\n% of revenues 13.9 12.1 15.2 11.8 11.2 ‑ ‑ 12.3 \n\nOPERATING PROFIT 519 296 214 402 103 (101) - 1,433 \n\n        \n\n —\n\n —\n\n(1) Operating margin, an alternative performance measure monitored by the Group, is defined in Note\xa03 – Alternative performance measures.\n\n\n\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION \nConsolidated accounts\n\n232 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n5.\n\nNote 5  Consolidated Income Statement\n\nIncome and expenses are presented in the Consolidated Income \nStatement by function. Operating expenses are broken down into \nthe cost of services rendered (corresponding to costs incurred for \nthe execution of client projects), selling expenses, and general and \nadministrative expenses.\n\nThese three captions represent operating expenses which are \ndeducted from revenues to obtain the operating margin*, one of \nthe main Group business performance indicators. Certain types \nof operating expense may be reclassified in previous periods in \naccordance with the presentation adopted in the reported fiscal \nyear; these reclassifications are without impact on operating \nmargin, net profit nor cash flows.\n\nOperating profit is obtained by deducting other operating income \nand expenses from the operating margin.\n\nOther operating income and expenses include amortization of \nintangible assets recognized in business combinations, the charge \nresulting from the deferred recognition of the fair value of shares \ngranted to employees (including social security contributions and \nemployer contributions), and non-recurring revenues and expenses, \nnotably impairment of goodwill, negative goodwill, capital gains \nor losses on disposals of consolidated companies or businesses, \nrestructuring costs incurred under a detailed formal plan approved \nby the Group’s management, the cost of acquiring and integrating \ncompanies acquired by the Group, including earn-outs comprising \n\nconditions of presence and the effects of curtailments, settlements \nand transfers of defined benefit pension plans.\n\nProfit for the year attributable to owners of the Company is then \nobtained by taking into account the following items:\n\n—  net finance costs, including net interest on borrowings \ncalculated using the effective interest rate, less income from \ncash, cash equivalents and cash management assets; \n\n— o ther financial income and expense, which primarily \ncorrespond to the impact of remeasuring financial \ninstruments to fair value when these relate to items of a \nfinancial nature, disposal gains and losses and the impairment \nof investments in non-consolidated companies, net interest \ncosts on defined benefit pension plans, exchange gains and \nlosses on financial items, and other financial income and \nexpense on miscellaneous financial assets and liabilities \ncalculated using the effective interest rate, as well as the \ninterest expense on lease liabilities; \n\n—  current and deferred income tax expense; \n\n—  share of profit of associates; \n\n—  share of non-controlling interests.\n\n* Operating margin, an alternative performance measure monitored by the \nGroup, is defined in Note\xa03 – Alternative performance measures.\n\nNote 6  Revenues\n\nThe method for recognizing revenues and costs depends on the \nnature of the services rendered:\n\nDeliverable-based contracts\n\nDeliverable-based contracts typically include fixed price projects, \nfor example, system integration or design and development of \ncustomized IT systems and related processes. Contract terms \ntypically range from 6\xa0months to 2\xa0years. Contract prices might \nbe subject to incentives and penalties, based on achievement of \nspecified performance targets or levels of benefits delivered to \nthe customer.\n\nFor deliverable-based contracts, revenue is generally recognized \nover time, because at least one of the following conditions is met: \n(i)\xa0the Group’s performance enhances an asset that the customer \ncontrols as the Group performs or (ii)\xa0the Group builds an asset \nthat has no alternative use (e.g. it is customer-specific) and the \nGroup has an enforceable right to payment for performance to \ndate in case of termination by the customer.\n\nThe Group applies the “cost-to-cost” method to measure progress\nto completion. The percentage of completion is based on costs\nincurred to date relative to the total estimate of cost at completion\nof the contract. Estimates of total contract costs are revised when\nnew elements arise. Changes in estimates of cost at completion\nand related percentage of completion are recorded in the Incom\nStatement as catch-up adjustments in the period in which the\nelements giving rise to the revision are known.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\ne \n \n\nThe related costs on deliverable-based contracts are expensed \nas incurred.\n\nThe Group earns contractually the right to bill upon achievement \nof specified milestones or upon customer acceptance of work \nperformed. The difference between cumulative billings and \ncumulative revenue recognized is reflected in the balance sheet as \nContract assets (revenue in excess of billings) or Contract liabilities \n(billings in excess of revenue).\n\nResources-based contracts\n\nRevenue from Resources-based contracts is recognized as the \nGroup earns the right to bill the customer as the amount invoiced \ncorresponds directly to the value to the customer of the performance \ncompleted to date. Each performance obligation is satisfied over \ntime as the client continuously receives and consumes the benefits \nof the services. The services are priced based on the number of hours \nspent on the contract. The amount to be billed is representative of \nthe value of the service delivered to the customer and therefore, \napplying the right-to-bill practical expedient, revenue is recognized \nover time based on the hours spent.\n\nThe related costs on resources-based contracts are expensed as \nincurred.\n\nServices-based contracts\n\nServices-based contracts include infrastructure management, \napplication management and Business Services activities. Contract \nterms typically range from 3\xa0to 5\xa0years. Fees are billable on a \nmonthly basis, based on a fixed-price per work unit consumed, or \nbased on monthly fixed fees subject to adjustment mechanisms \nfor volume changes or scope changes. Contracts generally provide \nfor service-level penalties.\n\n\n\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION \nConsolidated accounts\n\nCAPGEMINI 233\n\n5.\n\nRecurring services are generally considered to be one single \nperformance obligation, comprised of a series of distinct daily units \nof service satisfied over time. Contract modifications are recorded \non a prospective basis. Revenue on services-based contracts is \nrecognized as rights to bill arise, except in specific cases where \ninvoicing terms do not reflect the value to the customer of services \nrendered to date relative to the value of the remaining services (for \nexample, in case of significant front-loaded or backloaded fees or \ndiscounts). Service-level penalties or bonuses, if any, are accrued \nin full in the period when the performance targets are failed or \nachieved, as appropriate.\n\nUpfront fees received from customers, if any, are deferred and \nrecognized over the service period, even if non-refundable. Upfront \namounts payable to customers, if in excess of the fair value of \nassets transferred from the customer, are capitalized (presented \nin Contract assets) and amortized over the contractual period, as \na deduction to revenue.\n\nResale activities\n\nAs part of its operational activities, the Group may resell hardware \nequipment, software licenses, maintenance and services purchased \nfrom third-party suppliers. When the asset or service is distinct from \nthe other services provided by the Group, the Group needs to assess \nwhether it is acting as an agent or a principal in the purchase and \nresale transaction. The Group acts as a “principal” when it obtains \ncontrol of the hardware, software or services before transferring \nthem to the customer. In such case, the transaction is presented \non a gross basis in the Income Statement (amounts charged by \nsuppliers are presented in operating expenses). If the Group acts \nas an “agent”, the transaction is recorded on a net basis (amounts \ncharged by suppliers are recorded as a deduction to revenue). For \nexample, transactions are recorded on a net basis when the Group \ndoes not have the primary responsibility for the fulfillment of the \ncontract and does not bear inventory and customer acceptance risk.\n\nRoyalties\n\nUnder product engineering partnership agreements granting the \nGroup licenses over IBM software, Capgemini receives royalties from \nIBM for the use of these licenses. These royalties are calculated \nusing contractually-defined rates, applied to sales by IBM to its \nend customers.\n\nMulti-deliverable contracts\n\nThese contracts are long-term complex contracts with multiple \nphases which may include design, transition, transformation, build \nand service delivery (run).\n\nThe Group may be required to perform initial transition or\ntransformation activities under certain recurring service contacts.\nInitial set-up activities, mainly transition phases, necessary to\nenable the ongoing services, are not considered to be performance\nobligations. Any amount received in connection with those activities\nare deferred and recognized in revenue over the contractual service\nperiod. The other activities performed during the initial phase\nlike design, transformation and build are treated as a separate\nperformance obligation if they transfer to the customer the\ncontrol of an asset or if the customer can benefit from those initial\nactivities independently from the ongoing service. In such cases,\nthe corresponding revenues are generally recognized over time.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nWhen multiple Performance Obligations are identified within a \nsingle contract, the Group allocates the total contract price to the \nPerformance Obligations based on their relative Standalone Selling \nPrice (“SSP”). In the absence of directly observable prices for similar \nservices sold separately to similar customers, SSPs are estimated \nbased on expected costs plus a margin rate commensurate with \nthe nature and risk of the service.\n\nVariable remuneration\n\nEstimates of incentives, penalties, and any other variable revenues \nare included in the transaction price, but only to the extent that \nit is highly probable that the subsequent resolution of the price \ncontingency will not result in a significant reversal of the cumulative \nrevenue previously recognized. To make such an estimate, the Group \nconsiders the specific facts and circumstances of the contract \nand its experience with similar contracts. Changes in estimates \nof variable consideration are recorded as cumulative catch-up \nadjustments to revenue.\n\nCosts to obtain and fulfill contracts\n\nSales commissions incurred to obtain multi-year service contracts \nare capitalized and amortized over the contract period. Commissions \nare not capitalized if the amortization period is one year or less.\n\nCosts incurred prior to the signature of an enforceable contract \nare capitalized only if they are directly attributable to the design \nor set-up phase of a specifically identified contract, if the signature \nof the contract is probable, and if the costs are expected to be \nrecoverable from the contract.\n\nCosts incurred to fulfill the contracts are expensed as incurred with \nthe exception of certain initial set-up costs, such as transition and \ntransformation costs that do not represent a separate performance \nobligation, which are capitalized if they create a resource that the \nGroup will use to perform the promised service.\n\nReimbursements received from customers are recognized as \nrevenue, as costs are incurred.\n\nA provision for onerous contracts is recorded if all the costs necessary \nto fulfill the contract exceed the related benefits.\n\nPresentation in the Consolidated Statement of \nFinancial Position\n\nContract assets are presented separately from trade receivables. \nContract assets reflect revenue recognized for which the \ncorresponding rights to receive consideration are contingent \nupon something other than the passage of time, such as the \nGroup’s future performance, achievement of billing milestones, \nor customer acceptance. When customer contract assets are no \nlonger contingent, except for the passage of time, they convert \ninto trade receivables.

The decrease is mainly due to:\n\n—  the transitional impact of the 2017 US tax reform which \nrepresented a charge of €60\xa0million in 2019 compared to a \nprofit of €8\xa0million in 2020, a decrease of 5.1\xa0basis points of \nETR; \n\n—  the impact of permanent differences – especially the \nuntaxed capital gain net of disposal costs on the sale of \nOdigo- partially offset by the non-recognition of a deferred \ntax asset on tax losses carried forward of the fiscal year due \nto uncertainties relating to the global health crisis, a net \ndecrease of 3\xa0basis points of ETR.\n\nIn 2020, “Taxes not based on taxable profit” primarily consist of:\n\n— i n France: the Corporate Value-Added Contribution \n(Cotisation sur la Valeur Ajoutée des Entreprises, CVAE); \n\n—  in the United States, certain State taxes; \n—  in Italy, the regional tax on productive activities (IRAP).\n\nThe tax profit of €8\xa0million in 2020 due to the transitional impact \nof the 2017 US tax reform, comprises:\n\n—  the Base Erosion and Anti-abuse Tax (BEAT): this alternative \ntax is applicable from 2018. The tax rate is 10% from 2019. The \ntax base is distinct from the corporate income tax base and \nincludes certain payments to non-US Group entities, normally \ndeductible for tax purposes.

When determining the IFRS\xa02\xa0expense \nmeasuring the benefit granted to employees, the Group adjusts the \namount of the discount granted to employees on the subscription \nprice based on the following two items:\n\n—  the cost of the non-transferability of shares granted to \nemployees during a period of five years. This cost is measured \ntaking account of the five-year lock-in period. It corresponds \nto the cost of a two-stage strategy under which the market \nparticipant enters into a forward sale effective at the end of \nthe five-year lock-in period and simultaneously borrows the \namount necessary to buy a share available for immediate \ntransfer. This borrowing is financed with the proceeds from \nthe forward sale of the share and the dividends received \nduring the lock-in period. This cost is calculated based on the \nfollowing assumptions:\n\n–  the subscription price is set by the Chief Executive Oficer \npursuant to the powers delegated by the Board of \nDirectors. This subscription price is equal to the average \nCapgemini\xa0SE share price, weighted for volumes, during \nthe twenty trading days preceding the decision of the \nChief Executive Oficer, to which a discount is applied,\n\n–  the grant date is the date at which employees are fully \ninformed of the specific characteristics and terms and \nconditions of the offer and particularly the subscription \nprice,\n\n–  the loan rate granted to employees and used to determine \nthe cost of the non-transferability of shares is the rate at \nwhich a bank would grant a consumer loan repayable on \n\nmaturity without allocation to a private individual with \nan average risk profile, for a term corresponding to the \nterm of the plan; \n\n—  the opportunity gain reflecting the possibility granted to \nemployees to benefit from market terms and conditions \nidentical to those of the Group.\n\nIn certain countries where the set-up of a leveraged plan through \nan Employee Savings Mutual Fund (fonds commun de placement \nentreprise) or directly in the name of the employee is not possible, \nthe employee share ownership plan (ESOP) includes a Stock \nAppreciation Rights (SAR) mechanism. The benefit offered by the \nGroup corresponds to the amount of the discount on the share \nsubscription price.\n\nTreasury shares\n\nCapgemini\xa0SE shares held by the Company or by any consolidated \ncompanies are shown as a deduction from equity, at cost. Any \nproceeds from sales of treasury shares are taken directly to equity, \nnet of the tax effect, such that the gain or loss on the sale, net of \ntax, does not impact the Income Statement for the period.\n\nDerivative instruments on own shares\n\nWhen derivative instruments on own shares satisfy IAS\xa032\xa0classification \ncriteria for recognition in equity, they are initially recognized in equity \nin the amount of the consideration received or paid. Subsequent \nchanges in fair value are not recognized in the financial statements, \nother than the related tax effect.\n\nWhere these instruments do not satisfy the aforementioned criteria, \nthe derivative instruments on own shares are recognized in assets \nor liabilities at fair value. Changes in fair value are recognized in \nprofit or loss. The fair value remeasurement of these instruments \nat the year-end is recognized based on external valuations.\n\nIncentive instruments and employee share ownership\n\nA)  Share subscription plans\n\nThe Group no longer grants stock options since the plan authorized \nin 2005.

This plan was granted as part of the IGATE \nacquisition and was only subject to presence conditions. A total \nof 111,200\xa0shares have been vested under the February\xa02016 plan, \nrepresenting 61.6% of shares initially granted.\n\nThe assessment of performance conditions under the July\xa02016 \nplan concluded that the internal performance condition was \n100% attained and the external performance condition was 80% \nattained, given the performance of the Capgemini\xa0SE share, which, \nwhile above that of the comparison basket, was below the 110% \nthreshold enabling the maximum allocation. Satisfaction of the \npresence condition at the end of July\xa02020 led to the vesting of \n813,195\xa0shares on August\xa01, 2020 to non-French beneficiaries.

This plan was \ngranted as part of the IGATE acquisition and was only subject to \npresence conditions.\n\nThe assessment of performance conditions under the October\xa02017 \nplan concluded that the internal performance condition was \n100% attained and the external performance condition was 60% \nattained, given the performance of the Capgemini\xa0 SE share, \nwhich, while above that of the comparison basket, was below the \n110% threshold enabling the maximum allocation. Satisfaction of \nthe presence condition at the end of September\xa02020 led to the \nvesting of 322,350\xa0shares in October\xa02020 to French beneficiaries.\n\nb)  Performance conditions of the plans\n\nIn accordance with the AMF recommendation of December\xa08, 2009 \nregarding the inclusion of an internal and external performance \ncondition when granting performance shares, the Board of Directors \ndecided as from the 2010 plan to add an internal condition to the \nexternal condition initially planned.\n\nThe following internal and external performance conditions apply:\n\nUnder the 2012 to 2017 plans, the external performance condition \naccounts for 50% of the grant calculation as does the internal \nperformance condition.\n\nExternal performance condition\n\nThe terms of the external performance condition were tightened \nfor the 2016 to 2018 plans, compared with the preceding plans \nunder which shares began to vest from a Capgemini\xa0SE share \nperformance of at least 90% of the basket.\n\nAccordingly, since 2016, under these plans:\n\n—  no shares are granted if the performance of the\nCapgemini\xa0SE share during the period in question is less than\nthe performance of the basket of securities over the same\nperiod;\n\n—  the number of shares ultimately granted:\n\n–  is equal to 50% of the number of shares initially allocated\nif the performance of the Capgemini\xa0SE share is at least\nequal to 100% of the basket,\n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n(1) Organic free cash flow, an alternative performance measure monitored by the Group, is defined in Note\xa03 – Alternative performance measures and Note\xa023 – Cash flows.\n\n–  is equal to 100% of the number of shares initially allocated \nif the relative performance of the Capgemini\xa0SE share is \nhigher than or equal to 110% of the basket,\n\n–  varies on a straight-line basis between 50% and 100% of \nthe initial allocation, based on a pre-defined schedule, \nwhere the performance of the Capgemini\xa0 SE share is \nbetween 100% and 110% of the basket.\n\nMoreover, in 2019, an outperformance condition was added \napplicable to all beneficiaries except corporate oficers, such that \nif the relative performance of the share reaches or exceeds 120% \nof the basket, the allocation may amount to 110% of the external \nperformance portion (but the final grant may not exceed 100% \nof the initial grant).\n\nThe composition of the benchmark basket changed as follows:\n\n—  2014, 2015 and 2016 plans: Accenture/CSC/Atos/Tieto/\nCAC\xa0 40 index/CGI Group/Infosys/Sopra/Cognizant. Listing \nof the CSC security was ceased on April\xa0 1, 2017 and it \nwas therefore replaced in the basket by the Euro Stoxx \n600\xa0Technology index from this date for the 2015 and 2016 \nplans,\n\n—  for the 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 plans, the basket comprises \nthe following companies: Accenture/Indra/Atos/Tieto/CGI \nGroup/Infosys/Sopra Steria/Cognizant and two indices, the \nCAC\xa040 index and the Euro Stoxx 600\xa0Technology index.\n\nThe fair value of shares subject to external performance conditions \nis adjusted for a discount calculated in accordance with the Monte \nCarlo model, together with a discount for non-transferability for \nthe shares granted in France.\n\nInternal performance condition\n\nThe internal performance condition is based on the generation of \norganic free cash flow (1) (OFCF) over a three period encompassing \nfiscal years 2016 to 2018 for the 2016 plan, fiscal years 2017 to 2019 \nfor the 2017 plan, fiscal years 2018 to 2020 for the 2018 plan, fiscal \nyears 2019 to 2021 for the 2019 plan and fiscal years 2020 to 2022 \nfor the 2020 plan. Accordingly:\n\n—  no shares will be granted in respect of the internal \nperformance condition if the cumulative increase in \norganic free cash flow over the reference period is less than \n€2,400\xa0million for the 2016 plan, €2,900\xa0million for the 2017 \nplan, €3,000\xa0million for the 2018 plan, €3,100\xa0million for the \n2019 plan and €3,400\xa0million for the 2020 plan; \n\n—  100% of the initial internal allocation will be granted if \norganic free cash flow is equal to or exceeds €2,700\xa0million \nfor the 2016 plan, €3,200\xa0 million for the 2017 plan, \n€3,250\xa0 million for the 2018 plan, €3,400\xa0 million for the \n2019 plan and €3,700\xa0million for the 2020 plan. The trigger \nthreshold for application of the 110% outperformance bonus \nis €3,700\xa0million for the 2019 plan and €3,900\xa0million for the \n2020 plan (but the final grant may not exceed 100% of the \ninitial grant for these two plans).\n\nThe fair value of shares subject to internal performance conditions \nis calculated assuming 100% realization and will be adjusted where \nnecessary in line with effective realization of this condition. A \ndiscount for non-transferability is also applied for the shares \ngranted to French beneficiaries.\n\n\n\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION \nConsolidated accounts\n\nCAPGEMINI 247\n\n5.\n\nInclusion of a new CSR performance condition since 2018\n\nThe Board of Directors’ meeting of March\xa013, 2018 wished to align \nthe performance conditions with the Group’s strategic priorities \nby proposing the inclusion of a performance condition based on \ndiversity and sustainable development objectives reflecting the \n\nGroup’s corporate, social and environmental responsibility strategy. \nThis provision was retained in 2020 and in view of the inclusion of \nan outperformance condition, the following table summarizes the \napplicable performance conditions, under the 2020 plan, for each \nof the three conditions:\n\nSummary of performance conditions applicable to beneficiaries of the 2020 plan\n\nWeighting \napplied \n\nfor other \nbeneficiaries\n\nWeighting \napplied for \n\nmanagers (1)  \nPercentage of the grant determined by  \neach performance conditionPerformance condition\n\nMarket condition: Performance of the \nCapgemini share over a three-year period\n\n35% 15% —  0% if Capgemini share performance < 100% of \nthe average performance of the basket\n\n—  50% if equal to 100%\n—  100% if equal to 110%\n—  110% if the average performance of the \n\nshare is at least equal to 120% of the average \nperformance of the basket (for beneficiaries \nother than Executive Corporate Oficers)\n\nFinancial condition: organic free cash flow \nfor the three-year cumulative period from \nJanuary\xa01, 2020 to December\xa031, 2022\n\n50% 70% —  0% if < €3,400\xa0million\n—  30% if equal to €3,400\xa0million  \n\n(Executive Corporate Oficers)\n—  50% if equal to €3,400\xa0million for other \n\nbeneficiaries\n—  100% if equal to €3,700\xa0million\n—  110% if at least equal to €3,900\xa0million  \n\n(for beneficiaries other than Executive \nCorporate Oficers)\n\nCSR condition comprising two objectives:\n\nDiversity: increase in the number of women \nin the Vice-President inflow population over \na three-year period (2020-2022)\n\n7.5% 7.5% —  0% if the % of women in the Vice-President \ninflow population through recruitment or \ninternal promotion is < 26.5%\n\n—  30% if equal to 26.5%\n—  100% if equal to 29%\n—  110% if at least equal to 30%  \n\n(for beneficiaries other than Executive \nCorporate Oficers)\n\nReduction in the carbon footprint at \nend-2022 compared with 2019\n\n7.5% 7.5% —  0% if the reduction in greenhouse gas \nemissions/person is < 10%\n\n—  30% if equal to 10%\n—  100% if equal to 15%\n—  110% if at least equal to 16%  \n\n(for beneficiaries other than Executive \nCorporate Oficers)\n\n   \n\n(1) Executive Corporate Oficers (Chairman and Chief Executive Oficer and Chief Operating Oficers), members of the general management team and key executive managers \nof the Group.\n\nC)  International employee share ownership plan – \nESOP 2017\n\nThe Group set up an employee share ownership plan (ESOP 2017) \nin the second-half of 2017.

All of these shares were canceled in December\xa02020.\n\nImpact of incentive instruments and employee share \nownership plans\n\nThe following table presents the expense recognized in “Other \noperating income and expense” (including payroll taxes and \nemployer contributions) for incentive instruments and employee \nshare ownership plans and the residual amount to be amortized \nin future periods.\n\n2019 2020 \n\nResidual amount \nto be amortized  \n\nin future periods \n\nResidual amount \nto be amortized \n\nin future periods \nExpense of the \n\nperiod\nExpense of the \n\nperiod (in millions of euros) Note \n\nEXPENSE ON INCENTIVE \nINSTRUMENTS AND EMPLOYEE \nSHARE OWNERSHIP PLANS 8 105 270 105 311 \n\nTreasury shares and management of share capital \nand market risks\n\nThe Group does not hold any shares for financial investment \npurposes and does not have any interests in listed companies.\n\nAt December\xa0 31, 2020, treasury shares were deducted from \nconsolidated equity in the amount of €39\xa0million. These consist of \n(i)\xa0315,692\xa0shares purchased under the share buyback program and \n(ii)\xa084,883\xa0shares held under the liquidity agreement (for which the \ncash and UCITS balances are around €25\xa0million) and the contractual \nholding system for key employees of American activities.\n\nIn view of the small number of treasury shares held, the Group \nis not therefore exposed to significant equity risk. Finally, as the \nvalue of treasury shares is deducted from equity, changes in the \nshare price do not impact the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\nThe Group’s capital management strategy is designed to maintain a \nstrong capital base in view of supporting the continued development \nof its business activities and delivering a return to shareholders, \nwhile adopting a prudent approach to debt. At December\xa031, \n2020, the Group had net debt (1) of €4,904\xa0million (compared with \n\n€600\xa0million at December\xa031, 2019). In order to best manage the \nstructure of its capital, the Group can notably issue new shares, \nbuy back its own shares, adjust the dividend paid to shareholders \nor enter into derivative instruments on its own shares.\n\nCurrency risk and translation gains and losses on the \naccounts of subsidiaries with a functional currency \nother than the euro\n\nRegarding risks arising on the translation of the foreign currency \naccounts of consolidated subsidiaries, in 2020 the Group’s \nconsolidated financial statements are particularly impacted by \nfluctuations in the US dollar and in the Indian rupee, generating a \nnegative impact on foreign exchange translation reserves resulting \nfrom the depreciation of these two currencies against the euro \nduring the year 2020.\n\nThe Group does not hedge risks arising on the translation of the \nforeign currency accounts of consolidated subsidiaries whose \nfunctional currency is not the euro. The main exchange rates used \nfor the preparation of the financial statements are presented in \nNote\xa02 – Consolidation principles and Group structure.\n\nNote 13  Goodwill and intangible assets\n\nGoodwill\n\nGoodwill is equal to the excess of the acquisition price (plus, \nwhere applicable, non-controlling interests) over the net amount \nrecognized in respect of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities \nassumed. Where an acquisition confers control with remaining \nnon-controlling interests (acquisition of less than 100%), the Group \nelects either to recognize goodwill on the full amount of revalued \nnet assets, including the share attributable to non-controlling \ninterests (full goodwill method) or on the share in revalued net \nassets effectively acquired only (partial goodwill method). This \nchoice is made for each individual transaction.\n\nGoodwill balances are allocated to the different cash-generating \nunits (as defined in Note\xa016 – Cash-generating units and asset \nimpairment tests) based on the value in use contributed to each unit.\n\nWhen a business combination with non-controlling interests \nprovides for the grant of a put option to these non-controlling \ninterests, an operating liability is recognized in the Consolidated \n\nStatement of Financial Position in the amount of the estimated \nexercise price of the put option granted to non-controlling interests, \nthrough a reduction in equity. Changes in this put option resulting \nfrom any changes in estimates or the unwinding of the discount \nare also recognized through equity. Any additional acquisitions \nof non-controlling interests are considered a transaction with \nshareholders and, as such, identifiable assets are not remeasured \nand no additional goodwill is recognized.\n\nWhen the cost of a business combination is less than the fair \nvalue of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the negative \ngoodwill is recognized immediately in the Income Statement in \n“Other operating income and expense”.\n\nAcquisition-related costs are expensed in the Income Statement \nin “Other operating income and expense” in the year incurred.\n\nGoodwill is not amortized but tested for impairment at least annually, \nor more frequently when events or changes in circumstances \nindicate that it may be impaired.\n\n\n\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION \nConsolidated accounts\n\nCAPGEMINI 249\n\n5.\n\nCustomer relationships\n\nOn certain business combinations, where the nature of the \ncustomer portfolio held by the acquired entity and the nature \nof the business performed should enable the acquired entity to \ncontinue commercial relations with its customers as a result of \nefforts to build customer loyalty, customer relationships are valued \nin intangible assets and amortized over the estimated term of \ncontracts held in the portfolio at the acquisition date.\n\nLicenses and software\n\nComputer software and user rights acquired on an unrestricted \nownership basis, as well as software and solutions developed \ninternally and which have a positive, lasting and quantifiable effect \non future results, are capitalized and amortized over 3\xa0to 5\xa0years.\n\nIBM licenses acquired through product engineering partnerships \nwere valued by discounting expected future operating cash flow \nprojections and are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods \nnot exceeding 10\xa0years.\n\nThe capitalized costs of software and solutions developed internally \nare costs that relate directly to their production, i.e. the salary costs \nof the staff that developed the relevant software.\n\nOther \nintangible \n\nassets\nCustomer \n\nrelationships\nLicenses and \n\nsoftware(in millions of euros) Goodwill Total \n\nGROSS\n\nAt January 1, 2019 7,522 835 481 270 9,108 \n\nTranslation adjustments 113 14 2 1 130 \n\nAcquisitions/Increase - - 48 - 48 \n\nInternal developments - - - 2 2 \n\nDisposals/Decrease - (5) (25) (9) (39) \n\nBusiness combinations 131 28 2 1 162 \n\nOther movements (14) - 10 (11) (15) \n\nAt December 31, 2019 7,752 872 518 254 9,396 \n\nTranslation adjustments (481) (68) (27) (15) (591) \n\nAcquisitions/Increase - - 46 4 50 \n\nInternal developments - - - 7 7 \n\nDisposals/Decrease (99) (113) (97) (11) (320) \n\nBusiness combinations 2,701 517 124 42 3,384 \n\nOther movements - - 3 (6) (3) \n\nAT DECEMBER 31, 2020 9,873 1,208 567 275 11,923 \n\nACCUMULATED AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT\n\nAt January 1, 2019 91 372 374 150 987 \n\nTranslation adjustments (1) 6 2 1 8 \n\nCharges and provisions - 70 51 10 131 \n\nReversals - (6) (23) (9) (38) \n\nBusiness combinations - - 2 - 2 \n\nOther movements - - 6 (7) (1) \n\nAt December 31, 2019 90 442 412 145 1,089 \n\nTranslation adjustments (12) (34) (16) (4) (66) \n\nCharges and provisions - 105 59 15 179 \n\nReversals - (112) (49) (11) (172) \n\nBusiness combinations - - - 1 1 \n\nOther movements - - 1 (4) (3) \n\nAT DECEMBER 31, 2020 78 401 407 142 1,028 \n\nNET\n\nAt December 31, 2019 7,662 430 106 109 8,307 \n\nAT DECEMBER 31, 2020 9,795 807 160 133 10,895 \n\n     \n\n     \n\n     \n\n\n\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION \nConsolidated accounts\n\n250 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n5.\n\nThe amounts recorded in “Business combinations” for Goodwill \nand Customer relationships primarily concern:\n\n—  in fiscal year 2020: the Altran acquisition (see Note\xa0 2 – \nConsolidation principles and Group structure),\n\n—  in fiscal year 2019: the acquisitions of the Leidos Cyber group \nin the United States and Konexus Consulting Group Gmbh in \nGermany.\n\nThe amounts recorded in “Disposals/Decrease” in fiscal year 2020 \nprimarily concern the sale of the Odigo business (see Note\xa02 – \nConsolidation principles and Group structure).\n\nIntangible assets by geographic area\n\n \nDecember 31, 2019 December 31, 2020 \n\nNet carrying \namount\n\nAcquisitions  \nduring the period\n\nNet carrying \namount \n\nAcquisitions \nduring the period (in millions of euros) \n\nNorth America 346 4 498 6 \n\nFrance 96 40 221 39 \n\nUnited Kingdom and Ireland 59 1 78 1 \n\nRest of Europe 19 3 192 8 \n\nAsia-Pacific and Latin America 125 2 111 3 \n\nINTANGIBLE ASSETS 645 50 1,100 57 \n\nNote 14  Property, plant and equipment (PP&E)\n\nProperty, plant and equipment\n\nThe carrying amount of property, plant and equipment is recorded \nin assets in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and \ncorresponds to the historical cost of these items, less accumulated \ndepreciation and any impairment.

This is \nestimated in each currency using available market data and taking \naccount of the average lease term. Lease payments may include \nfixed payments and variable payments that depend on an index \nor a rate known at inception of the contract. The lease liability is \ngenerally calculated over the firm lease term unless the Group is \nreasonably certain to extend or terminate the lease.\n\nThe lease liability is subsequently measured at amortized cost \nusing the effective interest rate.\n\nThe initial value of the lease right-of-use asset comprises the amount \nof the initial measurement of the lease liability, initial direct costs \nand any obligation to restore the asset. For the vehicle fleet, the \nGroup has elected not to separate non-lease components from \nlease components and to account for the entire contract as a single \nlease component. The lease right-of-use asset is depreciated over \nthe period adopted for the calculation of the lease liability.\n\nIn the Consolidated Income Statement, depreciation is recorded \nin the operating margin and interest is recorded in net financial \nexpenses.\n\nThe linked tax impact is recognized in deferred tax in accordance \nwith applicable tax legislation in the countries where the leases \nare recognized.\n\nLeases of assets with a low unit value, other than IT equipment, and \nshort-term leases are expensed directly in the operating margin.\n\nDescription of lease activities\n\nReal estate leases\n\nThe Group leases land and buildings for its ofices, as well as for \nits delivery centers.

Goodwill and \nassets with an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment at \nleast once a year.\n\nThe impairment test consists of assessing the recoverable amount \nof each asset or group of assets generating cash flows that are \nseparate from the cash flows generated by other assets or groups \nof assets (cash-generating units or CGU).\n\nThe recoverable amount is defined as the higher of the fair value \nless costs to sell of the cash-generating unit and its value in use:\n\n—  fair value is the amount obtainable in an arm’s length \ntransaction and is determined with reference to the price \nin a binding agreement or the market price in recent and \ncomparable transactions; \n\n—  value in use is based on the discounted future cash flows to \nbe derived from these cash-generating units.\n\nThe value in use of each cash-generating unit is measured using \nthe discounted future cash flow method, based on the various \nassumptions in the three-year strategic plan extrapolated over \na period of five years, including growth and profitability rates \nconsidered reasonable. Long-term growth rates and discount rates \nare determined taking account of the specific characteristics of each \nof the Group’s geographic areas. Discount rates reflect the weighted \naverage cost of capital, calculated notably based on market data \nand a sample of sector companies. When the recoverable amount \nof a cash-generating unit is less than its net carrying amount, the \nimpairment loss is deducted from goodwill to the extent possible \nand charged under “Other operating income and expenses”.\n\nGoodwill per cash‑generating unit\n\nThe allocation of goodwill to cash-generating units breaks down as follows:\n\n \nDecember\xa031, 2019 December\xa031, 2020 \n\nNet carrying\namount\n\n Net carrying \namount (in millions of euros) Gross value Impairment Gross value Impairment \n\nNorth America 2,731 (8) 2,723 3,278 (7) 3,271 \n\nFrance 1,489 (1) 1,488 2,024 (1) 2,023 \n\nUnited Kingdom and Ireland 1,004 - 1,004 1,182 - 1,182 \n\nBenelux 983 (12) 971 1,135 (12) 1,123 \n\nSouthern Europe 146 - 146 358 - 358 \n\nNordic countries 303 - 303 467 - 467 \n\nGermany and Central Europe 417 (31) 386 639 (31) 608 \n\nAsia-Pacific 546 - 546 691 - 691 \n\nLatin America 133 (38) 95 99 (27) 72 \n\nGOODWILL 7,752 (90) 7,662 9,873 (78) 9,795 \n\nThe increase in the gross value of goodwill comes mainly from the \nAltran acquisition and other acquisitions completed in 2020 (see \nNote 2 – Consolidation principles and Group structure).

The probability of recovering deferred \ntax assets is primarily assessed based on a 10-year plan, weighted \nfor the probability of future taxable profits being reported.\n\nThe main deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if, and only if, \nthe subsidiaries have a legally enforceable right to offset current \ntax assets against current tax liabilities, and when the deferred \ntaxes relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities\n\n(in millions of euros) December\xa031, 2019 December\xa031, 2020 \n\nDeferred tax assets 999 983 \n\nDeferred tax liabilities 185 230 \n\nNet deferred taxes 814 753 \n\n\n\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION \nConsolidated accounts\n\n256 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n5.\n\nRecognized deferred tax assets\n\nDeferred tax assets and movements therein break down as follows:\n\n(in millions of euros) Note \n\nTax loss  \ncarry‑ \n\nforwards\n\nTemporary \ndifferences on \n\namortizable \ngoodwill\n\nProvisions for \npensions  \n\nand other post‑ \nemployment \n\nbenefits\n\nOther \ndeductible \ntemporary \n\ndifferences\n\nTotal \ndeferred tax \n\nassets \n\nAt January\xa01, 2019 612 85 221 214 1,132 \n\nTranslation adjustments 10 - 7 2 19 \n\nDeferred tax recognized in the \nIncome Statement 10 (154) (22) (5) 9 (172) \n\nDeferred tax recorded in income \nand expense recognized in equity 4 - 19 (1) 22 \n\nOther movements, including \noffset with deferred tax liabilities 11 - (4) (9) (2) \n\nAt December\xa031, 2019 483 63 238 215 999 \n\nBusiness combinations 12 - 19 137 168 \n\nTranslation adjustments (33) (7) (11) (29) (80) \n\nDeferred tax recognized in the \nIncome Statement 10 (111) (25) (3) 49 (90) \n\nDeferred tax recorded in income \nand expense recognized in equity 59 - 25 (3) 81 \n\nOther movements, including \noffset with deferred tax liabilities - - - (95) (95) \n\nAT DECEMBER\xa031, 2020 410 31 268 274 983 \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nRecognized tax loss carry-forwards total €410 million at December 31, 2020 (€483 million at December 31, 2019) and primarily concern \nthe United States in the amount of €350 million and France in the amount of €41 million.\n\nDeferred taxes liabilities by nature\n\nDeferred tax liabilities and movements therein break down as follows:\n\n(in millions of euros) Note \n\nTax‑deductible \ngoodwill \n\namortization\nCustomer \n\nrelationships\n\nOther taxable \ntemporary \n\ndifferences\n\nTotal \ndeferred tax \n\nliabilities \n\nAt January\xa01, 2019 52 43 85 180 \n\nTranslation adjustments 1 - - 1 \n\nDeferred tax recognized in the Income \nStatement 10 3 (6) 11 8 \n\nDeferred tax recorded in income and expense \nrecognized in equity - - (1) (1) \n\nOther movements including offset with \ndeferred tax assets - - (3) (3) \n\nAt December\xa031, 2019 56 37 92 185 \n\nBusiness combinations - 131 20 151 \n\nTranslation adjustments (4) (3) (7) (14) \n\nDeferred tax recognized in the Income \nStatement 10 4 (10) - (6) \n\nDeferred tax recorded in income and expense \nrecognized in equity - - (2) (2) \n\nOther movements including offset with \ndeferred tax assets - (78) (6) (84) \n\nAT DECEMBER\xa031, 2020 56 77 97 230 \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION \nConsolidated accounts\n\nCAPGEMINI 257\n\n5.\n\nExpiry dates of tax loss carry‑forwards (taxable base)\n\n 2019 2020 \n\nAt December\xa031 (in millions of euros) Amount % Amount % \n\nBetween 1 and 5 years 38 1 63 2 \n\nBetween 6 and 10 years 1,121 44 1,125 41 \n\nBetween 11 and 15 years 520 20 266 10 \n\nBeyond 15 years (definite expiry date) - - 36 1 \n\nCarried forward indefinitely 893 35 1,254 46 \n\nTAX LOSS CARRY-FORWARDS (taxable base) 2,572 100 2,744 100 \n\no/w recognized tax losses 1,893 74 1,616 59 \n\no/w unrecognized tax losses 679 26 1,128 41 \n\nTax loss carry-forwards total €2,744 million at December 31, 2020 \n(€2,572 million at December 31, 2019) and primarily concern the \nUnited States in the amount of €1,439 million, France in the amount \n\nof €387 million, Brazil in the amount of €300 million and Spain in \nthe amount of €247 million.\n\nUnrecognized deferred tax assets\n\nAt December\xa031 (in millions of euros) 2019 2020 \n\nDeferred tax on tax loss carry-forwards 200 292 \n\nDeferred tax on other temporary differences 18 56 \n\nUnrecognized deferred tax assets 218 348 \n\nNote 18  Financial instruments\n\nFinancial instruments consist of:\n\n— fin ancial assets, including other non-current assets, trade \nreceivables, other current assets, cash management assets \nand cash and cash equivalents;

\n\n—  derivative instruments.\n\na)  Recognition of financial instruments\n\nFinancial instruments (assets and liabilities) are initially recognized \nin the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at their initial \nfair value.\n\nIFRS 9 provisions regarding the classification and measurement \nof financial assets are based on the Group’s management model \nand the contractual terms of financial assets. Depending on their \nclassification in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, \nfinancial assets and liabilities are subsequently measured at fair \nvalue through profit or loss, fair value through other comprehensive \nincome or amortized cost.\n\nFinancial liabilities are classified as measured at amortized cost or \nat fair value through profit or loss if held for trading.\n\nAmortized cost corresponds to the initial carrying amount (net \nof transaction costs), plus interest calculated using the effective \ninterest rate, less cash outflows (coupon interest payments and \nrepayments of principal and redemption premiums where applicable). \n\nAccrued interest (income and expense) is not recorded on the basis \nof the financial instrument’s nominal interest rate, but on the basis \nof its effective interest rate. An expected credit loss is recognized \non financial assets measured at amortized cost. Any loss in value \nis recognized in the Income Statement.\n\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is the amount for which \nan asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between \nknowledgeable, willing parties in an arm’s length transaction.\n\nFinancial instruments are recognized at inception and on subsequent \ndates in accordance with the methods described below. These \nmethods draw on the following interest rate definitions:\n\n—  the coupon interest rate or coupon, which is the nominal \ninterest rate on borrowings; \n\n—  the effective interest rate, which is the rate that exactly \ndiscounts the estimated cash flows through the expected \nterm of the instrument, or, where appropriate, a shorter \nperiod to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or \nliability at initial recognition. The effective interest rate takes \ninto account all fees paid or received, transaction costs, and, \nwhere applicable, premiums to be paid and received; \n\n—  the market interest rate, which reflects the effective interest \nrate recalculated at the measurement date based on current \nmarket parameters.\n\nFinancial instruments (assets and liabilities) are derecognized when \nthe related risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred, \nand when the Group no longer exercises control over the instruments.\n\n\n\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION \nConsolidated accounts\n\n258 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n5.\n\nb)  Derivative instruments\n\nDerivative instruments mainly comprise forward foreign exchange\npurchase and sale contracts (in the form of tunnels, where applicable)\nand interest rate swaps.\n\n \n \n\nWhen operating or financial cash flow hedges are eligible for hedge \naccounting, changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments \nare recognized firstly in “Income and expense recognized in equity” \nand subsequently taken to operating profit or net financial expense \nwhen the hedged item itself impacts the Income Statement.\n\nAll changes in the value of hedging costs (time value of foreign \nexchange options and forward element of foreign exchange \nforward contracts) are recognized in a separate component of \ncomprehensive income and released to profit or loss when then \nthe hedged flow is realized.\n\nOther derivative instruments are measured at fair value, with changes\nin fair value, estimated based on market rates or data provided by\n\n \n \n\nbank counterparties, recognized in the Income Statement at the \nreporting date.\n\nc)  Fair value measurement\n\nFair value measurement methods for financial and non-financial \nassets and liabilities as defined above are classified according to \nthe following three fair value levels:\n\n—  Level 1: fair values measured based on quoted prices \n(unadjusted) observed in active markets for identical assets \nor liabilities; \n\n—  Level 2: fair values measured using inputs other than quoted \nprices in active markets, that are observable either directly \n(i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); \n\n—  Level 3: fair values of assets or liabilities measured using \ninputs that are not based on observable market data \n(unobservable inputs).\n\nAs far as possible, the Group applies Level 1 measurement methods.\n\n\n\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION \nConsolidated accounts\n\nCAPGEMINI 259\n\n5.\n\nFinancial instrument classification and fair value hierarchy\n\nThe following table presents the net carrying amount of financial \nassets and liabilities and the fair value of financial instruments \nbroken down according to the three classification levels defined \n\nabove (except for financial instruments where the net carrying \namount represents a reasonable approximation of fair value).\n\n   Net carrying amount Fair value \n\nFair value\nthrough\nprofit or\n\nloss\n\n \n Fair value \n\nthrough \nequity \n\nDecember\xa031, 2020  \n(in millions of euros) \n\nHedge \naccounting \n\n Amortized \ncostNotes Level\xa01 Level\xa02 Level\xa03 \n\nFINANCIAL ASSETS\n\nShares in non-consolidated \ncompanies\n\n19 14 13 27\n\nLong-term deposits, \nreceivables and other \ninvestments\n\n19 163\n\nOther non-current assets 19 213\n\nCurrent and non-current asset \nderivative instruments\n\n19 and  \n21 \n\n100 100\n\nTrade receivables and  \nrelated accounts\n\n20 3,938\n\nOther current assets 21 530\n\nCash management assets 22 338 338\n\nCash and cash equivalents 22 2,836 2,836\n\nFINANCIAL LIABILITIES\n\nBonds 22 7,698\n\nLease liabilities 15 968\n\nDrawdowns on bank and \nsimilar facilities and other \nborrowings\n\n22 372\n\nLiabilities related to \nacquisitions of consolidated \ncompanies\n\n27 8 139 8\n\nOther current and \nnon-current liabilities\n\n27 329\n\nCurrent and non-current \nliability derivative instruments\n\n27 65 65\n\nAccounts and notes payable 28 3,358\n\nBank overdrafts 22 8\n\n         \n\n    \n\n      \n\n      \n\n     \n\n      \n\n      \n\n     \n\n     \n\n         \n\n      \n\n      \n\n      \n\n    \n\n      \n\n     \n\n      \n\n      \n\n\n\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION \nConsolidated accounts\n\n260 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n5.\n\nNote 19  Other non-current assets\n\nAt December\xa031 (in millions of euros) Notes 2019 2020 \n\nLong-term deposits, receivables and other investments 128 163 \n\nShares in associates 74 110 \n\nDerivative instruments 24 33 32 \n\nNon-current tax receivables 89 183 \n\nAltran Technologies non-consolidated securities 2 413 - \n\nOther non-consolidated securities 1 27 \n\nOther 28 30 \n\nOTHER NON-CURRENT ASSETS 23 766 545 \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nLong-term deposits, receivables and other investments consist \nmainly of aides à la construction (building aid program) loans and \nsecurity deposits and guarantees relating to leases.\n\nDerivative instruments primarily consist of the fair value of derivative \ninstruments contracted as part of the centralized management \nof currency risk in the amount of €32 million (current portion of \n€65 million, see Note 24 – Currency, interest rate and counterparty \nrisk management).\n\nNon-current tax receivables at December 31, 2020 mainly consist \nof the tax portion required by the Indian tax authorities following \ntax audits but challenged by the Group and certain tax credits to \nbe utilized in more than 12 months notably in France and Spain.\n\nAt December 31, 2019, the “Altran Technologies non-consolidated \nsecurities” line reflects the acquisition of 29,378,319 shares for a \ntotal disbursement of €413 million (see Note 2 – Consolidation \nprinciples and Group structure).\n\nNote 20  Trade receivables, contract assets and contract costs\n\nAt December\xa031 (in millions of euros) Note 2019 2020 \n\nTrade receivables 2,140 2,724 \n\nProvisions for doubtful accounts (19) (36) \n\nContract assets 1,176 1,148 \n\nTrade receivables and contract assets, excluding contract costs 23 3,297 3,836 \n\nContract costs 23 83 102 \n\nTRADE RECEIVABLES, CONTRACT ASSETS AND CONTRACT COSTS 3,380 3,938 \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\nTotal trade receivables and contract assets net of contract liabilities can be analyzed as follows in number of days’ annual revenue:\n\nAt December\xa031 (in millions of euros) Note 2019 2020 \n\nTrade receivables and contract assets, excluding contract costs 23 3,297 3,836 \n\nContract liabilities 23 (836) (1,044) \n\nTRADE RECEIVABLES AND CONTRACT ASSETS  \nNET OF CONTRACT LIABILITIES 2,461 2,792 \n\nIn number of days’ annual revenue 63 60 \n\n  \n\n  \n\nIn addition to the consolidation of Altran from April 1, 2020, changes \nin contract assets and liabilities in fiscal year 2020 are due to the \nfollowing usual factors:\n\n—  timing differences between revenue recognition, billing and \ncollection, leading to the recognition of trade receivables \nand contract assets (sales invoice accruals);

This margin may be adjusted upwards or downwards \naccording to the credit rating of Capgemini SE. The facility is also \nsubject to a fee on undrawn amounts equal to 35% of the margin. \nThe margin currently applicable is 0.45% and the fee on undrawn \namounts is 0.1575%.\n\nAn upgrade or downgrade in Capgemini SE’s credit rating would \nhave no impact on the availability of this credit facility. The other \nmain terms and conditions of the credit facility, in particular \nwith respect to certain financial ratios, are detailed in Note 30 – \nOff-balance sheet commitments.\n\nThis credit facility had not been drawn at December 31, 2020.\n\nNet debt/net cash and cash equivalents and  \nliquidity risk\n\nBond issues and outstanding short-term negotiable debt securities \nissued by Capgemini SE are the main borrowings that could expose \nthe Group to liquidity risk in the event of repayment.\n\nTo manage the liquidity risk that could arise from these borrowings \nbecoming due and payable, at the contractual due date or early, \nthe Group has implemented a conservative financing policy mainly \nbased on:\n\n—  prudent use of debt leveraging, coupled with limited use of \nany clauses that could lead to early repayment of borrowings; \n\n—  the maintenance of an adequate level of liquidity at all times; \n\n—  actively managing borrowing due dates in order to limit the \nconcentration of maturities; \n\n—  using diverse sources of financing, allowing the Group to \nreduce its reliance on certain categories of lenders.\n\nNet debt/net cash and cash equivalents and credit risk\n\nFinancial assets which could expose the Group to a credit or \ncounterparty risk mainly consist of financial investments: in \naccordance with Group policy, cash balances are not invested \nin equity-linked products, but in (i) negotiable debt securities \n(certificates of deposit), (ii) term deposits, (iii) capitalization \ncontracts or (iv) short-term money market mutual funds, subject \nto minimum credit rating and diversification rules.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, short-term investments totaled €1,921 million \nand comprise mainly (i) money market mutual fund units meeting \nthe criteria defined by ESMA (European Securities and Markets \nAuthority) for classification in the “monetary category”; and \n(ii) negotiable debt securities and term deposits maturing within \nthree months or immediately available, issued by highly rated \ncompanies or financial institutions (minimum rating of A2/P2 or \nequivalent). Consequently, these short-term investments do not \nexpose the Group to any material credit risk.\n\nNet debt by maturity at redemption value\n\nThe amounts indicated below correspond to the undiscounted \nvalue of future contractual cash flows. Future cash flows relating to \nthe outstanding bond issues were estimated based on contractual \nnominal interest rates and assuming the bonds would be redeemed \nin full at maturity.\n\nthe second one-year extension option, the maturity of this credit \nfacility was extended to July 27, 2021.\n\nLess  \nthan \n\n1\xa0year\nAt December\xa031, 2020  \n(in millions of euros) \n\nContractual \nmaturity \n\nCarrying \namount\n\nContractual \ncash flows\n\n1\xa0to \n2\xa0years\n\n2\xa0to \n5\xa0years\n\nBeyond \n5\xa0years\n\nCash and cash equivalents 2020 2,828 2,828 2,828 - - -\n\nCash management assets 2020 338 338 338 - - -\n\n2015 Bond issue – July 2023 2023 (1,011) (1,075) (25) (25) (1,025) -\n\n2016 Bond issue 2021 (500) (502) (502) - - -\n\n2018 Bond issue – October 2024 2024 (579) (624) (6) (6) (612) -\n\n2018 Bond issue – April 2028 2028 (503) (571) (9) (9) (27) (526)\n\nApril 2020 Bond issue – April 2022 2022 (503) (512) (6) (506) - -\n\nApril 2020 Bond issue – April 2026 2026 (802) (878) (13) (13) (39) (813)\n\nApril 2020 Bond issue – April 2029 2029 (1,002) (1,180) (20) (20) (60) (1,080)\n\nApril 2020 Bond issue – April 2032 2032 (1,202) (1,542) (28) (28) (85) (1,401)\n\nJune 2020 Bond issue – June 2025 2025 (799) (825) (5) (5) (815) -\n\nJune 2020 Bond issue – June 2030 2030 (797) (890) (9) (9) (27) (845)\n\nDrawdowns on bank and similar facilities and \nother borrowings 2020 (372) (372) (366) - (3) (3)\n\nBorrowings (8,070) (8,971) (989) (621) (2,693) (4,668)\n\nDerivative instruments on borrowings -\n\nNET DEBT (4,904) (5,805) 2,177 (621) (2,693) (4,668)\n\n \n\n      \n\n \n\n\n\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION \nConsolidated accounts\n\n266 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n5.\n\nNote 23  Cash flows\n\nThe Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows analyzes the year-on-year \nchange in cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.\n\nForeign currency cash flows are translated into euros at the average \nexchange rate for the year.

The \nhedging policy and the management of operational currency risk \n\nis centralized at parent company level. Currency risk is managed \nprimarily based on periodic reporting by subsidiaries of their \nexposure to currency risk over principally the coming 1 to 3 years. \nOn this basis, the parent company acting as an internal bank, grants \ninternal currency guarantees to subsidiaries and enters into currency \nhedges with its bank counterparties, primarily through forward \npurchase and sale foreign exchange contracts.\n\nThese hedging transactions are recorded in accordance with cash \nflow hedge accounting rules.\n\nThe Group determines the existence of an economic link between \nthe hedging instrument and the hedged item based on the currency, \namount and timing of their respective cash flows.\n\n\n\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION \nConsolidated accounts\n\n268 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n5.\n\nb)  Currency risk and hedging of financial transactions\n\nThe Group is exposed to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations \nin respect of:\n\n—  inter-company financing transactions, mainly within the \nparent company, these flows generally being hedged (in \nparticular using forward purchase and sale foreign exchange \ncontracts) excepted financial flows that are integral part of \nthe net investment in subsidiaries; \n\n—  fees paid to the parent company by subsidiaries whose \nfunctional currency is not the euro, flows being hedged as \nwell.\n\nc)  Sensitivity of revenues and the operating margin (1) to \nfluctuations in the main currencies\n\nA 10% fluctuation in the US dollar-euro exchange rate would trigger \na corresponding 2.8% change in revenues and a 2.7% change in \n\n(1) Operating margin, an alternative performance measure monitored by the Group, is defined in Note 3 – Alternative performance measures.\n\nthe operating margin (1) amount.

Conversely, a 100-basis point fall in interest \nrates would have had an estimated €12 million negative impact on \nthe Group’s net finance costs.\n\nCounterparty risk management\n\nIn line with its policies for managing currency and interest rate risks \nas described above, the Group enters into hedging agreements \nwith leading financial institutions. Accordingly, counterparty risk \ncan be deemed not material. At December 31, 2020, the Group’s \nmain counterparties for managing currency and interest rate risk \nare Barclays, BNP Paribas, CA CIB, Citibank, Commerzbank, hSBC, \nING, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Natixis, NatWest Group, Santander \nand Société Générale.\n\nNote 25  Provisions for pensions and other post‑employment benefits\n\nDefined contribution plans\n\nDefined contribution plans are funded by contributions paid by \nemployees and Group companies to the organizations responsible \nfor managing the plans. The Group’s obligations are limited to the \npayment of such contributions which are expensed as incurred. The \nGroup’s obligation under these plans is recorded in “Accounts and \nnotes payable”. Defined contribution plans are operated in most \nEuropean countries (France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, \nGermany and Central Europe, Nordic countries, Italy and Spain), in \nthe United States and in the Asia-Pacific area.\n\nDefined benefit pension plans\n\nDefined benefit pension plans consist of either:\n\n—  unfunded plans, where benefits are paid directly by the \nGroup and the related obligation is covered by a provision \ncorresponding to the present value of future benefit \npayments. Estimates are based on regularly reviewed \ninternal and external assumptions. These unfunded plans \ncorrespond mainly to retirement termination payments and \nhealthcare assistance plans; \n\n—  funded plans, where the benefit obligation is covered by \nexternal funds. Group contributions to these external funds \nare made in accordance with the specific regulations in force \nin each country.\n\nObligations under these plans are determined by independent \nactuaries using the projected unit credit method. Under this method, \neach period of service gives rise to an additional unit of benefit \nentitlement and each of these units is valued separately in order \nto obtain the amount of the Group’s final obligation.\n\nThe resulting obligation is discounted by reference to market yields \non high quality corporate bonds, denominated in the payment \ncurrency of benefits and consistent with forecast cash outflows \nof the post-employment benefit obligation.\n\nFor funded plans, only the estimated funding deficit is covered \nby a provision.\n\nCurrent and past service costs – corresponding to an increase in the \nobligation – are recorded in “Operating expenses” of the period.\n\nGains or losses on the curtailment, settlement or transfer of defined \nbenefit pension plans are recorded in “Other operating income” \nor “Other operating expense.”\n\nThe impact of discounting defined benefit obligations as well as \nthe expected return on plan assets are recorded net in “Other \nfinancial expense” or “Other financial income.”\n\nActuarial gains and losses correspond to the effect of changes in \nactuarial assumptions and experience adjustments (i.e. differences \nbetween projected actuarial assumptions and actual data) on the \namount of the benefit obligation or the value of plan assets. They \nare recognized in full in “Income and expense recognized in equity” \nin the year in which they arise (with the related tax effect).\n\n\n\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION \nConsolidated accounts\n\n270 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n5.\n\nBreakdown of provisions for pensions and other \npost‑employment benefits\n\nProvisions for pensions and other post-employment benefits comprise \nobligations under funded defined benefit plans (particularly in the \n\nUnited Kingdom and Canada) and obligations primarily relating to \nretirement termination payments (particularly in France, Germany \nand Sweden).\n\nProvision for pensions and other post‑employment benefits by main countries\n\n \n\nNet provision in \nthe Consolidated \n\nStatement of \nFinancial PositionObligation Plan assets\n\n(in millions of euros) 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 \n\nUK 3,593 3,681 (3,206) (3,412) 387 269 \n\nCanada 753 775 (516) (522) 237 253 \n\nFrance 283 319 (36) (38) 247 281 \n\nGermany 114 176 (69) (100) 45 76 \n\nSweden 31 31 (10) (11) 21 20 \n\nIndia 549 706 (483) (588) 66 118 \n\nOther 252 305 (209) (250) 43 55 \n\nPRESENT VALUE OF THE OBLIGATION AT DECEMBER\xa031 5,575 5,993 (4,529) (4,921) 1,046 1,072 \n\nMovements in provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefits during the last two fiscal years were as follows:\n\n \n\nNet provision in \nthe Consolidated \n\nStatement of \nFinancial PositionObligation Plan assets\n\n(in millions of euros) Notes 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 \n\nPRESENT VALUE OF THE OBLIGATION  \nAT JANUARY\xa01 4,855 5,575 (3,844) (4,529) 1,011 1,046 \n\nExpense for the period recognized  \nin the Income Statement 234 226 (133) (112) 101 114 \n\nService cost 7 74 91 - - 74 91 \n\nInterest cost 9 160 135 (133) (112) 27 23 \n\nImpact on income and expense  \nrecognized in equity 419 430 (370) (387) 49 43 \n\nChange in actuarial gains and losses 419 430 - - 419 430 \n\nImpact of changes in financial assumptions 501 469 ‑ ‑ 501 469 \n\nImpact of changes in demographic assumptions (54) (37) ‑ ‑ (54) (37) \n\nExperience adjustments (28) (2) ‑ ‑ (28) (2) \n\nReturn on plan assets (1)  - - (370) (387) (370) (387) \n\nOther 67 (238) (182) 107 (115) (131) \n\nContributions paid by employees 45 43 (45) (43) - - \n\nBenefits paid to employees (187) (215) 169 181 (18) (34) \n\nContributions paid - - (122) (156) (122) (156) \n\nTranslation adjustments 215 (324) (181) 276 34 (48) \n\nBusiness combinations - 249 - (136) - 113 \n\nOther movements (6) 9 (3) (15) (9) (6) \n\nPRESENT VALUE OF THE OBLIGATION  \nAT DECEMBER\xa031 5,575 5,993 (4,529) (4,921) 1,046 1,072 \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n(1) After deduction of financial income on plan assets recognized in the Income Statement and calculated using the discount rate.\n\n\n\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION \nConsolidated accounts\n\nCAPGEMINI 271\n\n5.\n\nAnalysis of the change in provisions for pensions and \nother post‑employment benefits by main country\n\nA)  UK\n\nIn the United Kingdom, post-employment benefits primarily consist \nof defined contribution pension plans.\n\nA very small number of employees accrue pensionable service \nwithin a defined benefit pension plan.\n\nIn addition, certain former and current employees accrue deferred \nbenefits in defined benefit pension plans. The plans are administered \nwithin trusts which are legally separate from the employer and are \ngoverned by a trustee board comprising independent trustees and \nrepresentatives of the employer.\n\nThe defined benefit pension plans provide pensions and lump sums \nto members on retirement and to their dependents on death. \nMembers who leave service before retirement are entitled to a \ndeferred pension.\n\nEmployees covered by defined benefit pension plans break down \nas follows:\n\n—  112 current employees accruing pensionable service (132 at \nDecember 31, 2019); \n\n—  7,005 former and current employees not accruing \npensionable service (7,224 at December 31, 2019); \n\n—  3,561 retirees (3,469 at December 31, 2019).\n\nThe plans are subject to the supervision of the UK Pension \nRegulator; the funding schedules for these plans are determined \nby the Board of Directors of each pension plans on the proposal \nof an independent actuary, after discussion with Capgemini UK \nPlc, the employer, as part of actuarial valuations usually carried \nout every three years.

These \ncovenants also apply to Group subsidiaries. They include restrictions \nprimarily relating to pledging assets as collateral, asset sales, \nmergers and similar transactions. Capgemini SE is also committed \nto standard obligations, including an agreement to maintain pari \npassu status.\n\nOn February 9, 2021, the Group renegotiated its syndicated credit \nfacility (see Note 32 – Subsequent events) and the financial ratios \n(as defined in IFRS) detailed above will no longer apply in 2021.\n\n\n\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION \nConsolidated accounts\n\nCAPGEMINI 277\n\n5.\n\nContingent liabilities\n\nIn the normal course of their activities, certain Group companies \nunderwent tax audits, leading in some cases to revised assessments \nin 2020 and previous years.\n\nProposed adjustments were challenged and litigation and \npre-litigation proceedings were in progress at December 31, 2020, \nnotably in France and India.\n\nIn France, the tax authorities consider that Capgemini SE’s \nreinsurance subsidiary located in Luxembourg takes advantage \n\nof a preferential tax regime and therefore that its profits should \nbe taxed in France, at Capgemini SE level.\n\nThe Indian subsidiaries of the Group have received several revised \nassessments or proposed revised assessments for income tax in \nrecent years.\n\nMost often, no amounts have been booked for these disputes in the \nconsolidated financial statements in so far as the Group considers \nit justifies its positions that the likelihood of winning is high.\n\nNote 31  Related-party transactions\n\nAssociates\n\nAssociates are equity-accounted companies over which the Group \nexercises significant influence.

We believe that the audit evidence we have \nobtained is suficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the \nConsolidated Financial Statements Section of our report.\n\nIndependence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence requirements of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) \nand the French Code of Ethics (Code de déontologie) for Statutory auditors, for the period from January 1st, 2020 to the date of our \nreport and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5 (1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 \nor in the French Code of Ethics (Code de déontologie) for Statutory auditors.\n\nJustification of Assessments – Key Audit Matters\n\nDue to the global crisis related to the Covid-19 pandemic, the financial statements of this period have been prepared and audited under \nspecific conditions. Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken in the context of the state of sanitary emergency have had \nnumerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and their financing, and have led to greater uncertainties on \ntheir future prospects. Those measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on the companies’ \ninternal organization and the performance of the audits.\n\nIt is in this complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles L. 823-9 and R. 823-7 of the French \nCommercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating \nto risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial \nstatements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion \nthereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n\n\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION \nConsolidated accounts\n\nCAPGEMINI 281\n\n5.\n\nRecognition of revenue and costs related to long-term service contracts\n\nRisks identified Our audit approach\n\nCapgemini is present in the consulting, digital transformation, \nTechnology and Engineering Services market and notably provides \nlong-term services.\n\nAs described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the \nmethod used to recognize revenue and costs related to long-term \ncontracts depends on the nature of the services rendered, as follows:\n\n—  Revenue from deliverable-based contracts is recognized \nover time by using the “cost-to-cost” method to measure \nprogress to completion. The percentage of completion is \nbased on costs incurred to date relative to the total estimate \nof cost at completion of the contract; \n\n—  Revenue from resources-based contracts is recognized as \nthe Group earns the right to bill the customer as the amount \ninvoiced corresponds directly to the value to the customer of \nthe performance completed to date; \n\n—  Revenue on services-based contracts is recognized as rights \nto bill arise, except in specific cases where invoicing terms do \nnot reflect the value to the customer of services rendered \nto date relative to the value of the remaining services (for \nexample, in case of significant front-loaded or back-loaded \nfees or discounts); \n\n—  Revenue on multi-deliverable contracts should be recognized \napplying the appropriate method as specified above, \ndepending on the performance obligations identified.\n\nCosts incurred to fulfill the contracts are expensed as incurred with \nthe exception of certain initial set-up costs, such as transition and \ntransformation costs that do not represent a separate performance \nobligation, which are capitalized if they create a resource that the \nGroup will use to perform the promised service.\n\nA provision for onerous contract is recorded if all the costs necessary \nto fulfil the contract exceed the related benefits.\n\nThe amount of revenue and the costs to be recognized for the \nperiod, and of any provisions for loss at completion at the closing \ndate, depends upon the Group’s ability to:\n\n—  identify all the performance obligations in the long-term \nmulti-service contracts and determine their related \naccounting treatment; \n\n—  measure the costs incurred for deliverable-based contracts \nor the total services rendered for resources-based and \nservices-based contracts; \n\n—  estimate the costs to be incurred until the end of the \ncontract.\n\nConsidering the judgments and estimates made by the management \nto determine how revenue and related costs should be recognized, \nwe deemed the recognition of revenue and costs related to long-term \nservice contracts to be a key matter in our audit.\n\nWe have updated our understanding of the process related to \nrecognizing various revenue flows.\n\nOur approach took into account the information systems used in \nrecognizing revenue and related costs by testing, with the assistance \nof our IT specialists, the effectiveness of the automatic controls \nfor systems impacting revenue recognition.\n\nOur work notably involved:\n\n—  assessing internal control procedures, identifying the most \nmanual or automatic relevant controls for our audit and \ntesting their design and operational eficiency; \n\n—  carrying out analytical audit procedures, and notably \nanalyzing material changes in revenue and margin from one \nperiod to another; \n\n—  based on a sample of contracts selected by using a \nmulti-criteria analysis:\n\n– a ssessing the performance obligations identified within \nthe context of the contract; \n\n–  assessing the method used to recognize revenue and \nrelated costs for each identified performance obligation; \n\n–  comparing the accounting data against the operational \nmonitoring of projects and assessing the reasonableness \nof the estimates used, particularly as regards to \nmeasuring costs to be incurred until the end of the \ncontract; \n\n— a ssessing the appropriateness of the information provided in \nthe notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n\n\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION \nConsolidated accounts\n\n282 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n5.\n\nAcquisition and measurement of Goodwill\n\nRisks identified Our audit approach\n\nAs part of its business development, the Group makes targeted \nacquisitions in order to expand its service offering. In the context \nof the purchase price allocation, the Group estimates the fair value \nof identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed for entities newly \nacquired, and recognizes goodwill as an asset in the consolidated \nfinancial statements.\n\nGoodwill corresponds to the difference between the purchase price \nand the net amount of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities \nassumed. Goodwill is allocated to the various cash generating \nunits (CGU).\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the total assets include €9,795m of \ngoodwill and €807m of customer relationships, as described in \nNote 13 to the consolidated financial statements. These amounts \nreflect notably the impact of Altran acquisition in March 2020 \ncontributing to goodwill and Customer Relationship for €2,578m \nand €503m respectively as described in Note 2 to the consolidated \nfinancial statements.\n\nAt least once a year, Management ensures that the net carrying \namount of goodwill recognized as an asset is not greater than the \nrecoverable amount. Indeed, an adverse change in the business \nactivities to which goodwill has been allocated, due to internal or \nexternal factors such as the financial and economic environment \nin markets where Capgemini operates, may have a significant \nadverse effect on the recoverable amount of goodwill and require \nthe recognition of impairment. In such a case, it is necessary to \nreassess the relevance and reasonableness of the assumptions used \nto determine the recoverable amounts and the reasonableness \nand consistency of the calculation method.\n\nThe impairment testing methods and details of the assumptions used \nare described in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. \nThe recoverable amount is determined based on value in use, which \nis calculated based on the present value of the estimated future \ncash flows expected to arise from the asset group comprising each \ncash generating unit.\n\nWe believe that acquisitions and measurement of goodwill is \na key audit matter, due to their sensitivity to the assumptions \nmade by Management and their significant amount reported in \nthe financial statements.\n\nOur work entailed:\n\n—  assessing the compliance of the Altran acquisition accounting \nmethod adopted with IFRS 3R – Business Combination; \n\n— a ssessing the reasonableness of the approach undertaken to \nidentify the acquired assets and assumed liabilities; \n\n—  assessing the reasonableness of the assumptions used to fair \nvalue the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including \ntax risks; \n\n— a ssessing the appropriateness of the method used to identify \ncash generating units (CGU); \n\n— g aining an understanding of and assessing the impairment \ntesting process implemented by Management; \n\n— a ssessing the appropriateness of the model used to calculate \nvalue in use; \n\n—  analyzing the consistency of cash flow forecasts with \nManagement’s latest estimates presented to the Board of \nDirectors as part of the budget process; \n\n—  comparing the cash flow forecasts for financial years 2021 to \n2023 with the business plans used for prior year impairment \ntesting; \n\n—  comparing 2020 earnings forecasts used for prior year \nimpairment testing with actual results; \n\n—  interviewing the financial and operational staff responsible \nfor the geographic areas representing cash generating units \nto analyze the main assumptions used in the 3-year strategic \nplan and cross-check the assumptions with the explanations \nobtained; \n\n— a ssessing the methods used to calculate the discount rate \napplied to the estimated cash flows expected, as well as the \nlong-term growth rate used to project the latest prior year \nexpected cash flows to infinity; comparing these rates with \nmarket data and external sources and recalculating the rates \nbased on our own data sources; \n\n— a ssessing sensitivity testing of value in use to a change in the \nmain assumptions used by Management; \n\n— a ssessing the appropriateness of the financial information \nprovided in Notes 2, 13 and 16 to the consolidated financial \nstatements.\n\nOur firms’ valuation specialists were involved in this work.\n\n\n\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION \nConsolidated accounts\n\nCAPGEMINI 283\n\n5.\n\nTax Audit\n\nRisks identified Our audit approach\n\nThe Group is present in a large number of tax jurisdictions. The \ntax authorities in the countries in which the Group operates \nregularly control the Group’s position on subjects relating to its \nordinary business.\n\nAs stated in Note 30 to the consolidated financial statements \nfor the year ended December 31, 2020, tax audits may lead to \nproposed adjustments that are challenged and to litigation and \npre-litigation proceedings with the tax authorities, notably in \nFrance and India. These reassessments have not been accrued in \nthe financial statements, as the Group has justified its position \nand believes that it is probable that it will prevail.\n\nAs stated in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, certain \ntax risks have been fair valued in the context of the preliminary \npurchase price allocation of Altran Technologies in 2020.\n\nEstimates of risk relating to tax matters are reviewed regularly \nby each subsidiary and by the Group’s Tax Department, with the \nassistance of external counsels for the most significant or complex \nmatters.\n\nWe believe that tax audits are a key audit matter due to the Group’s \nexposure to tax issues related to its presence worldwide, the \npotential impact on the consolidated financial statements and the \nlevel of judgment required by Management in estimating the risk.\n\nThrough discussions with Management, we have updated our \nunderstanding of the procedures implemented by the Group to \nmonitor tax matters.\n\nWe have also assessed the judgments made by Management to \nmeasure the probability of tax payable and the amount of potential \nexposures, and the reasonableness of the estimates related to \ntax matters.\n\nWe focused in particular on the effect of changes in local tax \nregulations and ongoing disputes with local tax authorities.\n\nTo assess whether tax audits have been correctly addressed in \nthe consolidated financial statements, with the assistance of our \ntax experts we:\n\n—  conducted interviews with the Group’s Tax Department and \nwith local Tax Departments to assess the current status of \ninvestigations and reassessment proposals or reassessment \nnotices received from the tax authorities, and monitor \nthe status of ongoing claims, disputes and pre-litigation \nproceedings; \n\n— c onsulted the decisions and recent correspondence between \nthe Group’s companies and local tax authorities, along with \nthe correspondence between the companies concerned and \ntheir legal counsels, when required; \n\n—  performed a critical review of Management’s estimates and \nposition papers and of the consultations of external advisors.\n\n\n\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION \nConsolidated accounts\n\n284 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n5.\n\nSpecific verifications\n\nWe have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verification required by laws and \nregulations of the Group’s information given in the management report of the Board of Directors.\n\nWe have no matters to report as to their fair presentation and their consistency with the consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe attest that the consolidated non-financial statement required by Article L. 225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de \ncommerce) is included in the Group’s management report, it being specified that, in accordance with Article L. 823-10 of this Code, we \nhave verified neither the fair presentation nor the consistency with the consolidated financial statements of the information contained \ntherein. This information should be reported on by an independent third party.\n\nReport on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n\nFormat of the presentation of the consolidated financial statements intended to be included in the Annual \nFinancial Report\n\nIn accordance with Article 222-3, III of the AMF General Regulation, the Company’s management informed us of its decision to postpone \nthe presentation of the consolidated financial statements in compliance with the European single electronic format as defined in the \nEuropean Delegated Regulation No 2019/815 of December 17, 2018 to years beginning on or after January 1st, 2021. Therefore, this \nreport does not include a conclusion on the compliance with this format of the presentation of the consolidated financial statements \nintended to be included in the Annual Financial Report mentioned in Article L. 451-1-2, I of the French Monetary and Financial Code \n(Code monétaire et financier).\n\nAppointment of the Statutory auditors\n\nWe were appointed as Statutory auditors of Capgemini SE by the Annual General Meeting held on May 24, 1996 for PricewaterhouseCoopers \naudit and on May 20, 2020 for Mazars.\n\nAs at December 31, 2020, PricewaterhouseCoopers audit and Mazars were in the 25th year and 1st year of total uninterrupted engagement \nrespectively.\n\nResponsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial \nStatements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with \nInternational Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and for such internal control as management \ndetermines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, \nwhether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a \ngoing concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is \nexpected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations.\n\nThe Audit and Risk Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control \nand risks management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors.\n\nStatutory auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nObjectives and audit approach\n\nOur role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the \nconsolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, \nbut is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement \nwhen it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could \nreasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance \non the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional \njudgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n—  identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, \ndesigns and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be suficient and \nappropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than \nfor one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of \ninternal control;\n\n—  obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the \ncircumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;\n\n—  evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures \nmade by management in the consolidated financial statements;\n\n—  assesses the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence \nobtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s \nability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. \nhowever, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor \nconcludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures \n\n\n\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION \nConsolidated accounts\n\nCAPGEMINI 285\n\n5.\n\nin the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed \ntherein;\n\n—  evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the \nunderlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation;\n\n—  obtains suficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the \nGroup to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditor is responsible for the direction, \nsupervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion expressed on these \nconsolidated financial statements.\n\nReport to the Audit and Risk Committee\n\nWe submit a report to the Audit and Risk Committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit \nprogram implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding \nthe accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur report to the Audit and Risk Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of \nmost significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit \nmatters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit and Risk Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) N° 537/2014, confirming \nour independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L. 822-10 to L. 822-14 of \nthe French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics (Code de déontologie) for Statutory auditors. Where \nappropriate, we discuss with the Audit and Risk Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, \nand the related safeguards.\n\nThe Statutory auditors\n\nNeuilly-sur-Seine, February 26, 2021 Courbevoie, February 26, 2021\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Audit Mazars\n\nRichard Béjot\nPartner\n\nItto El hariri\nPartner\n\nDominique Muller\nPartner\n\nAnne-Laure Rousselou\nPartner\n\n\n\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION \nComments on the Capgemini\xa0SE financial statements\n\n286 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n5.\n\n5.3 C omments on the Capgemini\xa0SE financial statements\n\n5.3.1  Income Statement\n\nThe Company reported operating income for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2020 of €478 million (including €328 million in \nroyalties received from subsidiaries) compared with €447 million \nlast year (including €343 million in royalties).\n\nOperating profit is €238 million, compared with €275 million in 2019.\n\nThe net finance expense is €29 million (compared with net financial \nincome of €244 million in 2019) and reflects the difference between:\n\n—  income of €344 million, mainly comprising foreign \nexchange gains on the pooling of currency risk at Group \nlevel (€278 million), dividends received from subsidiaries \n(€30 million), reversals of provisions for equity interests \n(€18 million), income from loans granted to subsidiaries \n(€10 million) and reversals of provisions for foreign exchange \nlosses (€7 million); \n\n—  expenses of €373 million, mainly comprising foreign \nexchange losses on the pooling of currency risk at Group \n\nlevel (€186 million), charges to provisions for equity interests \n(€59 million), charges to provisions for foreign exchange \nlosses (€13 million), as well as interest on bond issues and \nbank borrowings (€111 million).\n\nThis €273 million increase in net financial expenses year-on-year \nis essentially due to the decrease in dividends received from \nsubsidiaries (€153 million), net reversals of provisions for equity \ninterests (€83 million) and the increase in interest on new bond \nissues (€56 million).\n\nNon‑recurring items mainly comprise the accelerated depreciation \nof company acquisitions costs and represent a net expense of \n€6 million, compared to nil last year.\n\nAfter an income tax expense of €21 million (compared with \n€29 million in 2019), notably reflecting the income tax expense of \nthe tax consolidation group, the Company reported a net profit \nof €182 million.\n\n5.3.2 Balance sheet \n\nFinancial fixed assets rose from €18,365 million last year to \n€22,967 million at December 31, 2020. This €4,602 million increase \nis mainly attributable to:\n\n—  the acquisition of an additional 88.57% stake in Altran \nTechnologies in 2020 for €3,318 million; \n\n—  the increase in amounts receivable from controlled entities \nof €1,287 million, mainly corresponding to the grant of a \n€1,510 loan to our Altran Technologies subsidiary, partially \noffset by the repayment of the loan to our US subsidiary for \n€225 million.\n\nShareholders’ equity is €14,122 million, down €140 million on last \nyear. This decrease essentially reflects the difference between:\n\n—  net profit for 2020 (€182 million); \n\n—  the €278 million share capital increase for cash reserved for \nemployees (ESOP 2020); \n\n—  the share capital reduction by cancellation of \n3,664,862 Capgemini SE shares purchased under the \nshare buyback programs authorized by the Combined \nShareholders’ Meetings of May 23, 2018 and May 20, 2020 in \nthe amount of €382 million,\n\n—  and finally, the June 5, 2020 dividend payment of €1.35 per \nshare on the 167,177,747 shares making up the Company’s \n\nshare capital at June 5, 2020 (after neutralization of the \n2,271,952 treasury shares held by the Company), representing \na total payment of €226 million; \n\nBorrowings totaled €10,503 million at December 31, 2020, up \n€5,387 million compared with December 31, 2019. This increase \nwas mainly due to:\n\n—  new bond issues totaling €5,100 million to finance the Altran \nTechnologies acquisition; \n\n—  the redemption of the 2015 bond issue maturing in July 2020 \nfor €676 million; \n\n—  the €510 million increase in bank loans and borrowings \n(including €350 million of commercial paper); \n\n—  the €451 million increase in outstanding inter-company loans \nand investments.\n\nIn addition to the above, the following information is required by law:\n\nCapgemini SE external accounts payable total €94 thousand, \nincluding €32 thousand not yet due. Group accounts payable total \n€42 million, none of which are due.\n\nInter-company accounts receivable total €31,020 thousand, including \n€1,593 thousand past due.

They are also prepared in accordance with the \nprinciples of prudence and accruals, and assuming that the Company \nis able to continue as a going concern.\n\nItems in the financial statements are generally measured using the \nhistorical cost method. The Company’s main accounting policies \nare described below:\n\nIntangible assets\n\nComputer software and user rights acquired on an unrestricted \nownership basis, as well as software developed for internal use \nwhich has a positive, lasting and quantifiable effect on future \nresults, are capitalized and amortized over a maximum period of \nthree years. At the year-end, the value of computer software and \nuser rights is compared to their value in use for the Company.\n\nFinancial fixed assets\n\nThe gross value of equity interests and other long-term investments \ncarried in the balance sheet comprises their acquisition cost, including \nany transaction fees. A provision for impairment is set aside when \nthe value in use falls below the acquisition cost. The value in use \nis calculated based on either the present value of discounted \nfuture cash flows adjusted for net debt and deferred tax, where \napplicable, the Company’s share in net assets, or in certain cases, \nwith reference to the market value of comparable transactions.\n\nTreasury shares\n\nTreasury shares held by Capgemini SE as part of the liquidity \nagreement are recorded on the balance sheet within long-term \ninvestments at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Realizable \nvalue is the average market price for Capgemini SE shares in \nDecember. Other treasury shares held for other objectives of the \nshare buyback program are recorded in listed shares.\n\nMarketable securities\n\nMarketable securities are shown on the balance sheet at the lower \nof cost and net realizable value. The realizable value of listed \nsecurities is based on the average share price in December. The \nrealizable value of unlisted securities is based on their net asset \nvalue. At the year-end, accrued interest receivable or interest \nreceived in advance on certificates of deposit and commercial paper \nis recognized in accrued income or prepaid income, respectively.\n\nCapitalization contracts subscribed by the Company are also \nincluded in marketable securities.\n\nForeign currency transactions\n\nReceivables, payables and cash and cash equivalents denominated \nin foreign currencies are translated into euros at the year-end \nexchange rate or at the hedging rate. Any differences resulting \nfrom the translation of foreign currency receivables and payables \nat these rates are included in the balance sheet under “Unrealized \nforeign exchange gains/losses”. A provision for foreign exchange \nlosses is set aside to cover any unrealized losses.\n\nReceivables and payables\n\nReceivables are measured at their nominal amount, and a provision \nfor impairment set aside when their net realizable value falls \nbelow their net carrying amount. Unbilled payables are recognized \nexcluding VAT.\n\nFinancial instruments\n\nCurrency and interest rate positions are taken using financial \ninstruments presenting minimum counterparty risk listed on \norganized markets or over-the-counter. Gains and losses on financial \ninstruments used in hedging transactions are recognized to match \nthe gains and losses arising on the hedged items. Forward financial \ninstruments, and options on own shares, are initially recognized in \nthe balance sheet at acquisition cost and subsequently remeasured \nto fair value. Where there is indication of impairment, a provision \nfor financial risk is set aside in accordance with the principle of \nprudence.\n\nCentralized foreign currency hedging transactions are recognized \nin accordance with hedge accounting rules. Unhedged transactions \nare recognized in isolated open positions. Any unrealized losses \nare provided. In addition the impact of hedging on inter-company \nloans and receivables is spread over the hedge term.\n\nTax consolidation\n\nThe Company and French subsidiaries at least 95% owned by the \nGroup have elected to file consolidated tax returns pursuant to \nArticle 223 A of the French General Tax Code. Any tax savings \nrealized by the tax consolidation group, primarily on account of \ntax losses incurred by consolidated entities, are treated as a gain \nfor the Company in the period in which they arise.\n\n\n\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION \n2020 financial statements\n\nCAPGEMINI 293\n\n5.\n\nII –  Notes to the Capgemini\xa0SE Balance Sheet and Income Statement\n\n1.

The subscription of \nCapgemini SE shares was proposed to approximately 97% of the \nGroup headcount in 26 countries. Under the plan, a minimum length \nof service of three months was required at November 12, 2020, \nacquired consecutively or not since January 1, 2019 to qualify as a \ncandidate for subscription. This leveraged plan offered employees \nthe possibility of subscribing at a discounted preferential rate and, \nvia a bank which secured and supplemented the investment so that \nthe total amount invested represented ten times the personal \ncontribution of the employee, potentially generating a greater \ncapital gain than would have been the case had it been calculated \nbased solely on the employee’s personal contribution. In return, \nthe employee waives a portion of any increase in the price of shares \nsubscribed on his behalf, as well as dividends and other financial \nrights that could be paid on these shares throughout the entire \nterm of the plan. In addition, the shares will be unavailable for a \nperiod of five years (except for cases of early release covered by \nplan rules in accordance with applicable legislation).\n\nThis employee share ownership plan (ESOP 2020) includes a 12.5% \ndiscount. Under the delegation of authority granted by the Board \nof Directors, the subscription price was set at €92.93 by the Chief \nExecutive Oficer on November 5, 2020. This price corresponds to the \ndaily volume-weighted average price (VWAP) of the Capgemini SE \nshare, as published on the Bloomberg CAP FP EQUITY VAP website, \nover the twenty stock market trading days preceding the Chief \nExecutive Oficer’s decision, less a 12.5% discount.\n\nOn December 17, 2020, the Group issued 3,000,000 new shares \nreserved for employees with a par value of €8 each, representing \na share capital increase of €278 million net of issue costs.\n\nPursuant to the share purchase agreement signed on October 7, \n2020 with an investment services provider, which is also the \ninstitution managing the ESOP 2020 employee share ownership \nplan, Capgemini SE purchased 3,000,000 of its own shares for a \nconsideration of €320 million to neutralize the dilution related \nto this plan.\n\nShare capital reduction by cancellation of shares \npurchased\n\nDuring the year, the Board of Directors, using the delegation of \nauthority granted for a period of 26 months by the 22nd extraordinary \nresolution adopted by the Combined Shareholders’ Meeting of \nMay 20, 2020, decided to reduce the share capital by €29,319 thousand \nby canceling 3,664,862 Capgemini SE shares purchased under the \nshare buyback program authorized by the Combined Shareholders’ \nMeetings of May 23, 2018 and May 20, 2020. The difference between \nthe purchase cost of these 3,664,862 shares and their par value of \n€352,626 thousand was deducted from additional paid-in capital.\n\n7.  Share subscription plans\n\nThe Group no longer grants stock options since the plan authorized \nin 2005. The last grant under this plan was performed in June 2008.\n\n8.

the 2016 and 2017 plans\n\nSatisfaction of the presence condition at the end of February 2020 \nled to the vesting of 104,200 shares on March 1, 2020 under the \nFebruary 2016 plan. This plan was granted as part of the IGATE \nacquisition and was only subject to presence conditions. A total \nof 111,200 shares have vested under the February 2016 plan, \nrepresenting 61.6% of shares initially granted.\n\nThe assessment of performance conditions under the July 2016 \nplan concluded that the internal performance condition was \n100% attained and the external performance condition was 80% \nattained, given the performance of the Capgemini SE share, which, \nwhile above that of the comparison basket, was below the 110% \nthreshold enabling the maximum allocation. Satisfaction of the \npresence condition at the end of July 2020 led to the vesting of \n813,195 shares on August 1, 2020 to non-French beneficiaries. A \ntotal of 1,178,005 shares have vested under the July 2016 plan, \nrepresenting 70.8% of shares initially granted.\n\nSatisfaction of the presence condition at the end of July 2020 led to \nthe vesting of 32,384 shares on August 1, 2020 under the July 2017 \nplan, representing 50.9% of shares initially granted. This plan was \ngranted as part of the Idean acquisition and was only subject to \npresence conditions.\n\nThe assessment of performance conditions under the October 2017 \nplan concluded that the internal performance condition was \n100% attained and the external performance condition was 60% \nattained, given the performance of the Capgemini SE share, \nwhich, while above that of the comparison basket, was below the \n110% threshold enabling the maximum allocation. Satisfaction of \nthe presence condition at the end of September 2020 led to the \nvesting of 322,350 shares in October 2020 to French beneficiaries.\n\nb)  Performance conditions of the plans\n\nIn accordance with the AMF recommendation of December 8, 2009 \nregarding the inclusion of an internal and external performance \ncondition when granting performance shares, the Board of Directors \ndecided as from the 2010 plan to add an internal condition to the \nexternal condition initially planned.\n\nThe following internal and external performance conditions apply:\n\nUnder the 2012 to 2017 plans, the external performance condition \naccounts for 50% of the grant calculation as does the internal \nperformance condition.\n\nExternal performance condition\n\nThe terms of the external performance condition were tightened \nfor the 2016 to 2018 plans, compared with the preceding plans \nunder which shares began to vest from a Capgemini SE share \nperformance of at least 90% of the basket.\n\nAccordingly, since 2016, under these plans:\n\n—  no shares are granted if the performance of the \nCapgemini SE share during the period in question is less than \nthe performance of the basket of securities over the same \nperiod; \n\n—  the number of shares ultimately granted:\n\n–  is equal to 50% of the number of shares initially allocated \nif the performance of the Capgemini SE share is at least \nequal to 100% of the basket,\n\n–  is equal to 100% of the number of shares initially allocated \nif the relative performance of the Capgemini SE share is \nhigher than or equal to 110% of the basket,\n\n–  varies on a straight-line basis between 50% and 100% of \nthe initial allocation, based on a pre-defined schedule, \n\nwhere the performance of the Capgemini SE share is \nbetween 100% and 110% of the basket.\n\nMoreover, in 2019, an outperformance condition was added \napplicable to all beneficiaries except corporate oficers, such that \nif the relative performance of the share reaches or exceeds 120% \nof the basket, the allocation may amount to 110% of the external \nperformance portion (but the final grant may not exceed 100% \nof the initial grant).\n\nThe composition of the benchmark basket changed as follows:\n\n—  2014, 2015 and 2016 plans: Accenture/CSC/Atos/Tieto/\nCAC 40 index/CGI Group/Infosys/Sopra/Cognizant. Listing \nof the CSC security was ceased on April 1, 2017 and it \nwas therefore replaced in the basket by the Euro Stoxx \n600 Technology index from this date for the 2015 and 2016 \nplans; \n\n—  the 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 plans, the basket comprises \nthe following companies: Accenture/Indra/Atos/Tieto/CGI \nGroup/Infosys/Sopra Steria/Cognizant and two indices, the \nCAC 40 index and the Euro Stoxx 600 Technology index.\n\nThe fair value of shares subject to external performance conditions \nis adjusted for a discount calculated in accordance with the Monte \nCarlo model, together with a discount for non-transferability for \nthe shares granted in France.\n\nInternal performance condition\n\nThe internal performance condition is based on the generation \nof organic free cash flow over a three-year period encompassing \nfiscal years 2016 to 2018 for the 2016 plan, fiscal years 2017 to \n2019 for the 2017 plan, fiscal years 2018 to 2020 for the 2018 plan, \nfiscal years 2019 to 2021 for the 2019 plan and fiscal years 2020 to \n2022 for the 2020 plan:\n\n—  no shares will be granted in respect of the internal \nperformance condition if the cumulative increase in \norganic free cash flow over the reference period is less than 5.\n€2,400 million for the 2016 plan, €2,900 million for the 2017 \nplan, €3,000 million for the 2018 plan, €3,100 million for the \n2019 plan and €3,400 million for the 2020 plan; \n\n—  100% of the initial internal allocation will be granted if \norganic free cash flow is equal to or exceeds €2,700 million \nfor the 2016 plan, €3,200 million for the 2017 plan, \n€3,250 million for the 2018 plan, €3,400 million for the \n2019 plan and €3,700 million for the 2020 plan. The trigger \nthreshold for application of the 110% outperformance bonus \nis €3,700 million for the 2019 plan and €3,900 million for the \n2020 plan (but the final grant may not exceed 100% of the \ninitial grant for these two plans).\n\nThe fair value of shares subject to internal performance conditions \nis calculated assuming 100% realization and will be adjusted where \nnecessary in line with effective realization of this condition. A \ndiscount for non-transferability is also applied for the shares \ngranted to French beneficiaries.\n\nInclusion of a new CSR performance condition since 2018\n\nThe Board of Directors’ meeting of March 13, 2018 wished to align \nthe performance conditions with the Group’s strategic priorities \nby proposing the inclusion of a performance condition based on \ndiversity and sustainable development objectives reflecting the \nGroup’s corporate, social and environmental responsibility strategy. \nThis provision was retained in 2020 and in view of the inclusion of \nan outperformance condition, the following table summarizes the \napplicable performance conditions, under the 2020 plan, for each \nof the three conditions:\n\n\n\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION \n2020 financial statements\n\n302 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n5.\n\nSummary of performance conditions applicable to beneficiaries of the 2020 plan\n\nWeighting \napplied \n\nfor other \nbeneficiaries\n\nWeighting \napplied for \n\nmanagers (1)  \nPercentage of the grant determined by  \neach performance conditionPerformance condition\n\nMarket condition: Performance of the \nCapgemini share over a three-year period\n\n35% 15% —  0% if Capgemini share performance < 100% of \nthe average performance of the basket\n\n—  50% if equal to 100%\n—  100% if equal to 110%\n—  110% if the average performance of the \n\nshare is at least equal to 120% of the average \nperformance of the basket (for beneficiaries \nother than Executive Corporate Oficers)\n\nFinancial condition: organic free cash flow \nfor the three-year cumulative period from \nJanuary 1, 2020 to December 31, 2022\n\n50% 70% —  0% if < €3,400 million\n—  30% if equal to €3,400 million  \n\n(Executive Corporate Oficers)\n—  50% if equal to €3,400 million for other \n\nbeneficiaries\n—  100% if equal to €3,700 million\n—  110% if at least equal to €3,900 million  \n\n(for beneficiaries other than Executive \nCorporate Oficers)\n\nCSR condition comprising two objectives:\n\nDiversity: increase in the number of women \nin the Vice-President inflow population over \na three-year period (2020-2022)\n\n7.5% 7.5% —  0% if the % of women in the Vice-President \ninflow population through recruitment or \ninternal promotion is < 26.5%\n\n—  30% if equal to 26.5%\n—  100% if equal to 29%\n—  110% if at least equal to 30%  \n\n(for beneficiaries other than Executive \nCorporate Oficers)\n\nReduction in the carbon footprint at \nend-2022 compared with 2019\n\n7.5% 7.5% —  0% if the reduction in greenhouse gas \nemissions/person is < 10%\n\n—  30% if equal to 10%\n—  100% if equal to 15%\n—  110% if at least equal to 16%  \n\n(for beneficiaries other than Executive \nCorporate Oficers)\n\n(1) Executive Corporate Oficers (Chairman and Chief Executive Oficer, Chief Executive Oficer, Chief Operating Oficers), members of the general management team and key \nexecutive managers of the Group.\n\n9.

We believe that the audit evidence we have \nobtained is suficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory auditors Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial \nStatements Section of our report.\n\nIndependence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence requirements of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) \nand the French Code of Ethics (Code de déontologie) for Statutory auditors, for the period from January 1, 2020 to the date of our report \nand specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5 (1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014.\n\nJustification of Assessments – Key Audit Matters\n\nDue to the global crisis related to the Covid-19 pandemic, the financial statements of this period have been prepared and audited under \nspecific conditions. Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken in the context of the state of sanitary emergency have had \nnumerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and their financing, and have led to greater uncertainties on \ntheir future prospects. Those measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on the companies’ \ninternal organization and the performance of the audits.\n\nIt is in this complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles L. 823-9 and R. 823-7 of the French \nCommercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating \nto risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements \nof the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, \nand we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the financial statements.\n\n\n\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION \n2020 financial statements\n\nCAPGEMINI 313\n\n5.\n\nMeasurement of investments in subsidiaries in Capgemini\xa0SE\n\nRisks identified Our audit approach\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, equity investments reported in the balance \nsheet amount to €21 357 million, including €3 733m of Altran shares. \nEquity investments are recognized at their acquisition-date cost \nand may be written down based on their value in use.\n\nAs stated in the Note “Accounting policies – Financial Assets” to the \nfinancial statements, a depreciation is accounted for should the \nvalue in use of the equity investments be lower than its carrying \namount. The value in use of equity investments is estimated by \nManagement, either using discounted future cash flows adjusted \nof net cash/debt and deferred taxes, or using the proportionate \nshare of consolidated net equity, or in some rare cases, based on \nthe market value of comparable transactions.\n\nThe measurement of the value in use requires judgment by \nManagement in terms of the inputs chosen, which may correspond \nto historical or forward-looking information.\n\nManagement ensures at year end that the carrying amount of \nthe equity investments is not higher than their value in use. An \nadverse change in the activities related to these investments, \ndue to internal or external factors related to the financial and \neconomic environment in the markets where Capgemini operates, \nmay significantly affect the value in use of the equity investments \nand require the recognition of an impairment. Such change would \nrequire reassessing the relevance of the assumptions used to \ndetermine value in use and the reasonableness and consistency \nof the calculation method.\n\nWe believe that measurement of the value of equity investments \nis a key audit matter given the significant amount of equity \ninvestments reported in the financial statements and their sensitivity \nto assumptions made by Management.\n\nOur work included:\n\n— g aining an understanding of and assessing the impairment \ntesting process implemented by Management; \n\n—  when value in use of equity investments is assessed using the \ndiscounted cash flow method:\n\n– a ssessing that the model used to calculate value in use is \nappropriate; \n\n–  analyzing the consistency of cash flow forecasts with the \nlatest estimates by Management presented to the Board \nof Directors during the budget process; \n\n–  comparing cash flow forecasts for financial years 2021 \nto 2023 with the business plans used for prior year \nimpairment testing, when applicable; \n\n–  comparing the 2020 earnings forecasts used for prior \nyear impairment testing with actual results, when \napplicable; \n\n–  interviewing financial and operational managers to \nanalyze the main assumptions used in the business plans \nand cross-check the assumptions with the explanations \nobtained; \n\n– a ssessing the methods used to calculate the discount \nrate applied to estimated future cash flows and the latest \nlong-term growth rate used to project cash flows to \ninfinity, for the latest financial year estimates; comparing \nthese rates with market data or external sources and \nrecalculating the rates based on our own data sources; \n\n–  comparing net cash/debt with underlying data used \nto prepare the Company’s consolidated financial \nstatements; \n\n—  when value in use of equity investments is measured based \non the proportionate share of consolidated net eq\nbased on the market value of comparable transaction\n\n– a ssessing the appropriateness of the valuation method \nused; \n\n–  assessing the documentation used to measure value in \nuse; \n\n— a ssessing the appropriateness of the financial information \nprovided in the notes to the annual financial statements.\n\nuity or \ns:\n\nOur firms’ valuation specialists were involved in this work.\n\n\n\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION \n2020 financial statements\n\n314 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n5.\n\nSpecific verifications\n\nWe have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verifications required by laws \nand regulations.\n\nInformation given in the management report and in the other documents with respect to the financial position \nand the financial statements provided to the Shareholders\n\nWe have no matters to report as to the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information given \nin the management report and in the other documents with respect to the financial position and the financial statements provided \nto the Shareholders.\n\nWe attest the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information relating to the payment deadlines \nmentioned in Article D. 441-6 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce).\n\nReport on Corporate Governance\n\nWe attest that the Board of Directors’ report on Corporate Governance sets out the information required by Articles L. 225-37-4, \nL. 22-10-10 and L. 22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce).\n\nConcerning the information given in accordance with the requirements of Article L. 22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code (Code de \ncommerce) relating to remunerations and benefits received by the directors and any other commitments made in their favour, we have \nverified its consistency with the financial statements, or with the underlying information used to prepare these financial statements \nand, where applicable, with the information obtained by your company from controlling and controlled companies. Based on these \nprocedures, we attest the accuracy and fair presentation of this information.\n\nOther information\n\nIn accordance with French law, we have verified that the required information concerning the purchase of investments and controlling \ninterests and the identity of the shareholders and holders of the voting rights has been properly disclosed in the management report.\n\nReport on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n\nFormat of the presentation of the financial statements intended to be included in the Annual Financial Report\n\nIn accordance with Article 222-3, III of the AMF General Regulation, the Company’s management informed us of its decision to postpone \nthe presentation of the financial statements in compliance with the European single electronic format as defined in the European \nDelegated Regulation N° 2019/815 of 17 December 2018 to years beginning on or after January 1st, 2021. Therefore, this report does \nnot include a conclusion on the compliance with this format of the presentation of the financial statements intended to be included in \nthe Annual Financial Report mentioned in Article L. 451-1-2, I of the French Monetary and Financial Code (Code monétaire et financier).\n\nAppointment of the Statutory auditors\n\nWe were appointed as Statutory auditors of Capgemini SE by the Annual General Meeting held on May 24, 1996 for PricewaterhouseCoopers \naudit and on May 20, 2020 for Mazars.\n\nAs at December 2020, PricewaterhouseCoopers audit and Mazars were in the 25th year and 1st year of total uninterrupted engagement.\n\nResponsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with French accounting \nprinciples and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that \nare free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, \ndisclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to \nliquidate the Company or to cease operations.\n\nThe Audit and Risk Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control \nand risks management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.\n\nThe financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors.\n\nStatutory auditors Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\n\nObjectives and audit approach\n\nOur role is to issue a report on the financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial \nstatements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that \nan audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements \ncan arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to \ninfluence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance \non the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\n\n\nFINANCIAL INFORMATION \n2020 financial statements\n\nCAPGEMINI 315\n\n5.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional \njudgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n—  identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs \nand performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be suficient and appropriate \nto provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one \nresulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal \ncontrol;\n\n—  obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the \ncircumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;\n\n—  evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures \nmade by management in the financial statements;\n\n—  assesses the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence \nobtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s \nability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. \nhowever, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor \nconcludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures \nin the financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein;\n\n—  evaluates the overall presentation of the financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying \ntransactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\nReport to the Audit and Risk Committee\n\nWe submit a report to the Audit and Risk Committee, which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit \nprogram implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding \nthe accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur report to the Audit and Risk Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of \nmost significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we \nare required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit and Risk Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) N° 537/2014, confirming \nour independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L. 822-10 to L. 822-14 of \nthe French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics (Code de déontologie) for Statutory auditors.

The number of shares granted (existing \nand to be issued) was not to exceed 1.2% of the share capital at \nthe date of the Board of Directors’ decision to grant such shares \n(this maximum number of shares being referred to hereafter by \nthe letter “N”). Up to a maximum of 10% of “N”, these performance \nshares could be granted to Executive Corporate Oficers of the \nCompany, it being specified that the portion of shares to be held \nby them until the end of their term of ofice is set by the Board of \nDirectors. By exception, and for an amount not exceeding 15% of \n“N”, shares could be granted to employees of the Company and \nits French and non-French subsidiaries, excluding members of the \ngeneral management team (the “Executive Committee”), without \nperformance conditions.\n\nPursuant to this authorization, the Board of Directors’ meeting of \nOctober 7, 2020 decided the issue of 1,900,000 performance shares \nto 2,431 managers and employees of the Group, 23 members of \nthe Executive Committee (excluding Executive Corporate Oficers) \nand Mr. Aiman Ezzat.\n\nThe external performance condition is based on the comparative \nperformance of the Capgemini share against the average performance \nof a basket of comparable companies or indexes over a minimum \nof three years.\n\nSince the performance share grant of 2012, the internal performance \ncondition for all performance share plans is based on organic free \ncash flow generation over a three-year period, reflecting the Board \nof Directors’ desire to prioritize long-term goals in the context of \nthese grants.\n\nA Corporate Social and Environmental Responsibility performance \ncondition was added for the first time in 2018 and included again \nthis year. It is founded on two indicators: a diversity indicator and \nan environmental performance indicator.\n\nFurthermore, the Board of Directors wished to be able to take \naccount of any outperformance in 2019 and again this year, by \ndefining targets that would allow 110% of the shares to vest \nrelative to each performance condition for all beneficiaries other \nthan Executive Corporate Oficers, while capping at 100% of the \nInitial Allocation the total percentage of shares that ultimately \nvest once the overall performance conditions are determined.\n\nAccordingly, the total number of shares that will vest to beneficiaries \nat the end of the vesting period will be equal to:\n\n—  a number of shares equal to 35% (for Executive Corporate \nOficers, the Group Executive Committee and key managers) \nor 15% (for other beneficiaries) of the number indicated \nin the grant notification multiplied by the percentage \nachievement of the chosen external performance target: \nperformance of the Capgemini share compared with the \naverage performance measured over an identical three \nyear period of a basket of securities and indexes containing \n(i) shares of eight listed companies operating in the same \n\nsector as the Group in a minimum of five countries in which \nthe Group is firmly established (Accenture/Indra/Tieto/Atos/\nCGI Group/Sopra Steria/Infosys and Cognizant) and (ii) the \nEuro Stoxx Technology 600 index and the CAC 40 index. No \nshares will vest if the relative performance of the Capgemini \nshare is less than 100% of the average performance of \nthe basket; 50% of the Initial Allocation will vest if the \nperformance of the Capgemini share is equal to the average \nperformance of the basket; 100% of the Initial Allocation will \nvest if the performance of the Capgemini share is equal to \n110% of the average performance of the basket and 110% of \nthe target (excluding Executive Corporate Oficers) will vest \nif the performance is at least equal to 120% of the average \nperformance of the basket; \n\n—  a number of shares equal to 50% (for Executive Corporate \nOficers, the Group Executive Committee and key managers) \nor 70% (for other beneficiaries) of the number indicated \nin the grant notification multiplied by the percentage \nachievement of the chosen internal performance target: \npublished and audited organic free cash flow for the three \nyears from 2020 to 2022 compared with a minimum objective \nof €3,400 million; 100% of the Initial Allocation will vest for \norganic free cash flow generation of €3,700 million and a \nmaximum of 110% of the Initial Allocation will vest (excluding \nExecutive Corporate Oficers) for organic free cash flow \ngeneration of €3,900 million; \n\n—  and finally, a number of shares equal to 15% of the \nnumber indicated in the grant notification multiplied by \nthe percentage achievement of the corporate social and \nenvironmental responsibility performance target: (i) increase \nover a three-year period in the percentage of women in the \nGroup’s Vice-President inflow population, with a minimum \nobjective of 26.5%, a target grant for an increase of 29% and \na maximum grant of 110% of the target (excluding Executive \nCorporate Oficer) for an increase of at least 30% and (ii) a \nreduction in greenhouse gas emissions/employee of at least \n10% by 2022 compared with 2019, with a target grant for a \nreduction of 15% and a maximum grant of 110% (excluding \nExecutive Corporate Oficer) of the target for a reduction of \n16% or more.\n\nThe vesting period was set by the Board of Directors at three \nyears for beneficiaries tax-resident in France and four years for \nbeneficiaries not tax-resident in France. In addition, a one-year \nminimum holding period for vested shares following the vesting \nperiod was set for beneficiaries tax-resident in France. Furthermore, \nthe Chief Executive Oficer is required to hold 50% of vested shares \nuntil the end of his term of ofice, if the number of shares held by \nhim valued at the share price at the vesting date is less than one \nyears’ theoretical salary. 33% of vested shares must be held if the \nvaluation of shares held is between one years’ theoretical salary \nand two years’ theoretical salary and 5% of vested shares must be \nheld if this valuation exceeds two years’ theoretical salary.\n\nOut of a total of 1,900,000 shares, 39,800 shares (2.09%) were \ngranted without performance conditions. No Group Executive \nCommittee members benefited from this grant.\n\nIn accordance with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, \nperformance share grants are undertaken at the same calendar \nperiods and are decided by either the Board of Directors’ meeting \nheld at the end of July or at the following meeting generally held \nat the beginning of October.

Where this option \nis not made, the dividend will fall within the application scope of \nthe flat-rate income tax advance payment mechanism and will not \nbe eligible for this 40% rebate.\n\nTaking account of the recommendations of certain investors, and \nso as not to encourage security lending/borrowing transactions \naround the date of the Shareholders’ Meeting, the Board of \nDirectors proposes an ex-dividend date of June 2, 2021 and a \ndividend payment date starting from June 4, 2021.\n\nTHIRD RESOLUTION\n\nAppropriation of earnings and setting of the dividend\n\nThe Shareholders’ Meeting, voting in accordance with quorum and majority rules for Ordinary Shareholders’ Meetings, approves the \nrecommendations of the Board of Directors to appropriate the net profit for the year ended December 31, 2020 as follows:\n\nNet profit for the year €181,627,000.73\n\n  No funding of the legal reserve as already fully funded\n\ni.e. a balance of: €181,627,000.73\n\n Retained earnings of previous years: €5,976,182,226.62\n\ni.e. distributable earnings: €6,157,809,227.35\n\n allocated to: \n – payment of a dividend of €1.95 per share\n – retained earnings for the balance:\n\n€329,130,432.15 (1) \n\n€5,828,678,795.20\n\ngiving a total of: €6,157,809,227.35\n\n(1) The total amount of the distribution is calculated based on the number of shares ranking for dividends at December 31, 2020 and could therefore change if this number \nvaries between January 1, 2021 and the ex-dividend date.\n\nIt should be noted that the dividend, set at €1.95 for each of the \nshares bearing dividend rights on January 1, 2021, will be fully \neligible for the 40% tax rebate referred to in Article 158.3.2° of \nthe French Tax Code (Code général des impôts) where an express, \nglobal and irrevocable election is made for taxation under the \nprogressive scale of personal income tax.\n\nThe ex-dividend date will be June 2, 2021 and the dividend will \nbe payable from June 4, 2021. If, at the time of payment of the \ndividend, the number of treasury shares held by the Company has \nchanged compared to that held on December 31, 2020, the fraction \nof the dividend relating to this variation will either increase or \nreduce retained earnings.\n\nPursuant to Article 243 bis of the French Tax Code, it is recalled that the following amounts were paid over the past three fiscal years:\n\n \n\nDividend  \ndistribution (1)   \n\n(in euros) \n\nDistributed  \nincome (2)   \n\n(in euros) \n\nDividend  \nper share  \n\n(in euros) \n\nFiscal year 2019 228,616,423.65 225,689,958.45 1.35\n\nFiscal year 2018 284,399,341.00 281,199,101.20 1.70\n\nFiscal year 2017 286,422,361.40 284,362,859.00 1.70\n\n(1) Theoretical values calculated based on the number of shares bearing dividend rights on December 31 each year. \n(2) Amounts effectively paid after adjusting the number of shares bearing dividend rights for any change in the number of treasury shares, the issuance of new shares and/or \n\nthe cancellation of existing shares between January 1 and the ex-dividend date. In fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019, these amounts were only fully eligible for the 40% tax \nrebate referred to in Article 158.3.2° of the French Tax Code (Code général des impôts) when the beneficiary was tax-resident in France and had opted for taxation at the \nprogressive income tax scale.\n\n\n\nREPORT OF ThE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND DRAFT RESOLUTIONS TO BE PRESENTED AT  \nThE COMBINED ShAREhOLDERS’ MEETING OF MAY 20, 2021\nResolutions presented at the Ordinary Shareholders’ Meeting\n\n338 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n7.\n\nPRESENTATION OF THE 4TH\xa0RESOLUTION\n\nREGULATED AGREEMENTS – SPECIAL REPORT OF THE STATUTORY AUDITORS\n\nOverview\n\nAll agreements governed by Article L. 225-38 of the French \nCommercial Code authorized by the Board of Directors during \nthe year ended December 31, 2020 concerned the acquisition \nby the Company of Altran Technologies through a tender offer  \n(“the Offer”).

This \nauthorization was used in 2020 in connection with the liquidity \ncontract (entered into with Kepler Cheuvreux) and more generally \nas part of the continued purchase by the Company of its own shares.\n\nThe liquidity contract seeks to improve the liquidity of the \nCapgemini SE share and to allow regular quotations. In 2020, a total \nof 1,063,201 shares were purchased on behalf of Capgemini SE, \nat an average price of €99.56 per share, representing 0.63% of \nthe share capital at December 31, 2020. During the same period, \n1,104,046 Capgemini shares were sold at an average price of \n€101.50 per share, representing 0.65% of the share capital \nat December 31, 2020. At the year-end, the liquidity account \npresented a balance of 20,964 shares (0.01% of the share capital) \nand approximately €25 million.\n\nIn addition, the Company continued to purchase its own shares \nin 2020. Excluding the liquidity contract, the Company held \n315,692 of its own shares at December 31, 2020, following the \nvarious transactions described below:\n\n—  purchase of 4,964,862 shares representing 2.94% of the \nshare capital at December 31, 2020, at an average price of \n€104.45 per share; \n\n—  transfer of 1,169,279 shares to employees under the free \nshare grant plan; \n\n—  cancellation of 3,664,862 shares.\n\nOf the 4,964,862 shares purchased outside the liquidity contract in \n2020, 3,000,000 shares were purchased to neutralize the dilutive \nimpact of the Group’s seventh employee share ownership plan \n(ESOP 2020). These shares were allocated for cancellation and \nwere part of the 3,664,862 shares canceled during the year.\n\nTrading fees (excluding VAT) and the financial transaction tax \ntotaled €1,703,701 in 2020.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, excluding the liquidity contract, all \n315,692 treasury shares held, representing 0.19% of the Company’s \nshare capital, were allocated to the grant or sale of shares to \nemployees and/or corporate oficers.\n\nFinally, it is noted that during fiscal year 2020, treasury shares \nheld by the Company were not reallocated between the different \nobjectives.\n\nAs part of the active management of the share capital, the Board \nof Directors decided on February 12, 2020 to authorize a new \nmulti-year share buyback program of an amount of €600 million \n(the “2020 Multi‑year Share Buyback Program”), in continuity \nwith the multi-year share buyback program previously authorized \nin February 2016 for an initial amount of €600 and increased by \n€500 million by the Board of Directors on December 7, 2016 (the \n“2016 Multi‑year Share Buyback Program”). The terms of these \ntwo multi-year share buyback programs fall within the scope of \nthe authorization granted by the Shareholders’ Meeting of May 20, \n2020 and any subsequent authorization, such as the one submitted \nfor approval in the 16th resolution.\n\nIn addition, as part of the active management of shareholder \ndilution related to the employee share ownership plan (ESOP \n2020), the Board of Directors, at its meeting of June 10 and 11, \n2020, authorized additional share buybacks supplementing the \n2016 Multi-year Share Buyback Program and the 2020 Multi-year \nShare Buyback Program, for a maximum amount of €450 million \nand within the limit of 3 million shares (the “ESOP 2020 Specific \nShare Buyback Program”) exclusively for the purpose of canceling \nshares thus acquired.\n\nDuring fiscal year 2020, shares buybacks by the Company outside \nthe liquidity contract were performed either under the 2016 \nMulti-year Share Buyback Program (which had a residual available \nbalance of €50 million at December 31, 2020) or under the ESOP \n2020 Specific Share Buyback Program. The 2020 Multi-year Share \nBuyback Program was not used.\n\nNew authorization requested in 2021\n\nAs in previous years, the new resolution submitted for approval \nprovides for the buy back by the Company of its own shares up \nto the statutory limit of 10% of the number of shares comprising \nthe share capital at the date of such purchases, and a maximum \nnumber of treasury shares held after such purchases not exceeding \n\n\n\nREPORT OF ThE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND DRAFT RESOLUTIONS TO BE PRESENTED AT  \nThE COMBINED ShAREhOLDERS’ MEETING OF MAY 20, 2021\n\nResolutions presented at the Ordinary Shareholders’ Meeting\n\nCAPGEMINI 345\n\n7.\n\n10% of the amount of the Company’s share capital at any time. \nThe maximum purchase price will be set at €190 per share. The \nCompany envisages using this authorization primarily in the context \nof its two multi-year share buyback programs and any potential \nmanagement of shareholder dilution under a new employee share \nownership plan, where applicable. The acquisition, disposal and \n\ntransfer transactions may be carried out by any means in accordance \nwith prevailing laws and regulations – including through the use of \nderivative instruments or by means of a block purchase or transfer \nof shares – and be carried out at any time, except during public \noffers for the company’s shares. This authorization is granted for \na limited period of 18 months.\n\nSIXTEENTH RESOLUTION\n\nAuthorization of a share buyback program\n\nThe Shareholders’ Meeting, voting in accordance with quorum and \nmajority rules for Ordinary Shareholders’ Meetings, and after having \nread the Board of Directors’ report, authorizes the Board of Directors, \nwith the power of sub-delegation to the extent authorized by law \nand in accordance with Articles L. 225-210 et seq. and L. 22-10-62 \net seq. of the French Commercial Code, to purchase or arrange \nthe purchase of the Company’s shares, particularly with a view to:\n\n—  the grant or sale of shares to employees and/or corporate \noficers (on the terms and by the methods provided by \nlaw), in particular with a view to the grant of free shares \npursuant to the provisions of Articles L. 225-197-1 et seq. \nand L. 22-10-59 et seq. of the French Commercial Code, \nthe grant or sale of shares to employees under the French \nstatutory profit-sharing scheme or the implementation of \nany company or group savings plan (or similar plan) on the \nterms provided by law, in particular Articles L. 3332-1 et seq. \nof the French Labor Code (Code du travail ), and generally, \nhonoring all obligations relating to share option programs \nor other share grants to employees or corporate oficers \nof the Company or a related company, or to permit the \nhedging of a structured employee share ownership plan by \na bank, or entity controlled by a bank within the meaning of \nArticle L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code, acting at the \nCompany’s request; or\n\n—  the delivery of shares on the exercise of rights attached to \nsecurities granting access to the share capital by redemption, \nconversion, exchange, presentation of a warrant or any other \nmeans; or\n\n—  the cancellation of some or all of the shares purchased; or\n\n—  the delivery of shares (in exchange, as payment, or otherwise) \nin connection with acquisitions, mergers, demergers or \nasset-for-share exchanges; or\n\n—  the management of the secondary market or maintenance \nof the liquidity of the Capgemini share by an investment \nservices provider under a liquidity contract that complies \nwith market practices accepted by the Autorité des marchés \nfinanciers (AMF – the French Financial Markets Authority).\n\nThis program is also intended to enable the implementation of \nany market practice that may be permitted by the AMF and more \ngenerally the carrying out of any transaction that complies with \nprevailing regulations. In such cases, the Company will inform its \nshareholders by means of a press release.\n\nPurchases of the Company’s own shares may be made such that, at \nthe date of each purchase, the total number of shares acquired by \nthe Company since the beginning of the buyback program (including \nthe shares subject to the current purchase) does not exceed 10% \nof the shares comprising the Company’s share capital at that date \n(including transactions impacting the share capital and performed \nafter this Shareholders’ Meeting), it being stipulated that (i) the \nnumber of shares purchased with a view to their retention or \npresentation in a merger, demerger or asset-for- share exchange \n\ntransaction may not exceed 5% of the Company’s share capital; \nand (ii) where the shares are repurchased to improve liquidity on \nthe terms set out in the AMF general regulations, the number of \nshares taken into account in calculating the above 10% limit will \nbe the number of shares purchased minus the number of shares \nresold during the authorization period.\n\nAcquisitions, sales and transfers of shares may be performed at \nany time other than during the period of a public offer for the \nCompany’s shares, subject to the limits authorized by prevailing \nlaws and regulations, and by any means, and particularly on \nregulated markets, via a multilateral trading facility or systematic \ninternalizer or over the counter, including by block purchases or \nsales, by public offer for cash or shares or using options or other \nforward financial instruments traded on regulated markets, via a \nmultilateral trading facility or systematic internalizer or over the \ncounter, either directly or through an investment services provider, \nor in any other manner (with no limit on the portion of the share \nbuyback program carried out by each of these means).\n\nThe maximum purchase price of shares purchased pursuant to this \nresolution will be €190 per share (or the equivalent at the same \ndate in any other currency). The Shareholders’ Meeting delegates \nto the Board of Directors powers to adjust the aforementioned \nmaximum purchase price in the event of a change in the par value \nof the share, a share capital increase by capitalizing reserves, a \nfree share grant, a stock split or reverse stock split, a distribution \nof reserves or any other assets, a share capital redemption, or any \nother transaction impacting share capital, to take account of the \nimpact of such transactions on the value of the shares.\n\nThe total amount allocated to the share buyback program authorized \nabove may not exceed €3,200 million.\n\nThe Shareholders’ Meeting confers full powers on the Board of \nDirectors, with the power of sub-delegation to the extent authorized \nby law, to decide and implement this authorization and if necessary \nto specify the conditions and determine the terms thereof, to \nimplement the share buyback program, and in particular to place \nstock market orders, enter into any agreement, allocate or reallocate \npurchased shares to desired objectives subject to applicable legal \nand regulatory conditions, set any terms and conditions that may \nbe necessary to preserve the rights of holders of securities or other \nrights granting access to the share capital in accordance with legal \nand regulatory provisions and, where applicable, any contractual \nterms stipulating other cases where adjustment is necessary, to \nmake declarations to the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF – \nthe French Financial Markets Authority) or any other competent \nauthority, to accomplish all other formalities and generally do all \nthat is necessary.\n\nThis authorization is granted for a period of eighteen months as \nfrom the date of this Shareholders’ Meeting.\n\nIt supersedes from this date, in the amount of any unused portion, \nthe authorization granted by the 20th resolution adopted by the \nCombined Shareholders’ Meeting of May 20, 2020.\n\n\n\nREPORT OF ThE

THE COMPANY’S BYLAWS\n\nOverview\n\nThe seventeenth resolution asks shareholders to amend Article 12, \nparagraph 2), of the Company’s bylaws regarding the deliberations \nof the Board of Directors and, in particular, the participation \nof directors at Board meetings using videoconference or \ntelecommunications facilities, in order to remove the exceptions \nregarding the appointment,

accordance with quorum and \nmajority rules for Extraordinary Shareholders’ Meetings, and after \n\nhaving read the Board of Directors’ report, resolves to amend Article \n12, paragraph 2, of the Company’s bylaws as follows:\n\n(Former wording)\nArticle 12, paragraph 2\n\nThe Charter of the Board of Directors may provide that directors \nwho participate in Board of Directors’ meetings via videoconference \nor telecommunications facilities making it possible, under the \nconditions provided for by the regulations, for them to be identified \nand guaranteeing their effective

18TH\xa0RESOLUTION\n\nSHARE GRANTS TO EMPLOYEES AND CORPORATE OFFICERS\n\nOverview\n\nDesirous to continue its motivation policy and involving employees \nand managers in the Group’s development, the Board of Directors \nis seeking a new authorization to grant additional performance \nshares, existing or to be issued, subject to internal and external \nperformance conditions, during the next 18 months, (with, in the \ncase of shares to be issued, the waiver by shareholders of their \npre-emptive subscription rights in favor of the beneficiaries of the \ngrants) up to a maximum of 1.2% of the share capital.\n\nThe performance conditions recommended by the Board of \nDirectors are set out below and in the draft eighteenth resolution \npresented to you for vote.\n\nAt the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the \nBoard of Directors’ meeting of March 18, 2021 wished to continue \naligning performance conditions with the Group’s strategic priorities \nand, in line with what was implemented for the first time in 2018, \nmaintained a performance condition reflecting the Group’s corporate, \nsocial and environmental responsibility strategy. In addition, the \nBoard of Directors wished to allow, as last year, outperformance \nto be taken into account by defining targets conditioning 110% \nof the relative grant for each of the performance conditions for \nall beneficiaries, excluding Executive Corporate Oficers, while \ncapping the total percentage of shares vested after recognition \nof all performance conditions at 100% of the initial grant.\n\n\n\nREPORT OF ThE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND DRAFT RESOLUTIONS TO BE PRESENTED AT  \nThE COMBINED ShAREhOLDERS’ MEETING OF MAY 20, 2021\n\nResolutions presented at the Extraordinary Shareholders’ Meeting\n\nCAPGEMINI 347\n\n7.\n\nProposed performance conditions for performance share grants:\n\n(i)  A market performance condition assessed based on the \ncomparative performance of the Capgemini SE share against \nthe average performance of a basket comprising eight \ncomparable companies in the same business sector and from \nat least five countries (Accenture/Atos/Tieto/Sopra Steria/\nCGI Group/Indra/Infosys and Cognizant) and the CAC 40 and \nEuro Stoxx Technology 600 indices.\n\nThis external performance condition would determine 35% \nof grants to Executive Corporate Oficers, members of the \ngeneral management team and key executive managers of the \nGroup and 15% of grants to other beneficiaries.\n\n(iii)  A performance condition tied to the Group’s 2023 \ndiversity and sustainable development objectives which \nwould determine 15% of grants to all beneficiaries, with \neach objective equally weighted. The diversity objective \nis based on a target increase in the percentage of women \nin the Group’s Vice-President inflow population over the \nperiod 2021-2023 to 30% (through internal promotion or \nrecruitment) and the sustainable development objective \nconcerns a 70% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions over \nthe period 2019-2023 for a vesting of 100% of the shares, in \naccordance with the Group’s new carbon neutral ambition \nfor 2025.\n\nNo shares would vest in respect of the external performance \ncondition if the relative performance of the Capgemini SE share \nis less than 100% of the average performance of the basket \nover a three-year period, 100% of the shares would vest if this \nperformance is 110% of that of the basket and 110% of the \ntarget (excluding Executive Corporate Oficers) would vest if \nthis performance is 120% of that of the basket.\n\n(ii)  A financial performance condition measured by the \namount of audited and published organic free cash flow for \nthe three-year cumulative period from January 1, 2021 to \nDecember 31, 2023, excluding Group payments to make up \nthe shortfall on its defined benefit pension funds.\n\nFor beneficiaries other than Executive Corporate Oficers, \nno shares would vest in respect of this financial performance \ncondition if the cumulative organic free cash flow for the \nthree fiscal years is less than €3,900 million, while 100% of \nthe shares would vest if this amount is at least €4,200 million \nand a maximum of 110% would vest if this amount is equal to \n€4,500 million.\n\nFor Executive Corporate Oficers, no shares would vest in \nrespect of this financial performance condition if the cumulative \norganic free cash flow for the three fiscal years is less than \n€3,900 million, while 80% of the shares would vest if this amount \nis at least €4,200 million and a maximum of 100% would vest \nif this amount is equal to €4,500 million.\n\nThis financial performance condition would determine 50% \nof grants to Executive Corporate Oficers, members of the \ngeneral management team and key executive managers of the \nGroup and 70% of grants to other beneficiaries.\n\nMore information on the methodology used to measure the \ngreenhouse gas emissions reduction objective can be found in the \n2020 Universal Registration Document, Section\xa04.1.3.\n\nSummary of recommended performance

Since 2017, such employee share ownership operations \nmay now be offered to Group employees on an annual basis, while \nultimately aiming to increase employee share ownership to around \n10% of the Company’s share capital.\n\nUse of the authorizations granted in 2020\n\nDuring fiscal year 2020, the Board of Directors used the 31st and \n32nd resolutions adopted by the Shareholders’ Meeting of May 20, \n2020, by launching a seventh employee share ownership plan \naimed at associating employees with the Group’s development \nand performance. This plan was a great success, with subscriptions \nexceeding 174%. Close to 41,000 employees in the 26 participating \ncountries subscribed to the plan, representing 16% of the Group’s \nheadcount. This new employee share ownership plan (ESOP \n2020) will help maintain employee share ownership over 6% of \nthe share capital.\n\n3,000,000 new shares, i.e. the maximum number of shares \noffered, were subscribed at a unit price of €92.23, representing \na total subscription of €278.8 million. The corresponding share \ncapital increase of €24 million at par value was completed on \nDecember 17, 2020.\n\nNew authorization requested in 2021\n\nShareholders are asked to renew the two authorizations by which \nthe Shareholders’ Meeting would delegate to the Board its power \nto increase the share capital or issue complex securities granting \naccess to share capital in favor of the Company’s employees. This \n\nwould allow the set-up of a new employee share ownership plan \nin the next eighteen months.\n\nAn overall ceiling of €32 million (corresponding to 4 million shares \nand representing approximately 2.3% of the share capital at \nDecember 31, 2020) is proposed for these two delegations.\n\nThe 19th\xa0resolution is intended to allow the Board to carry out share \ncapital increases up to a maximum par value amount of €32 million \nreserved for members of employee savings plans of the Company or \nthe Group. This resolution requires the cancellation of pre-emptive \nsubscription rights. The delegation would be granted for a period \nof eighteen months. The maximum discount authorized compared \nto the Reference Price (as defined in the resolution) would be 20% \n(or 30% in the case of a lock-up period of 10 years).\n\nThe 20th\xa0resolution aims to develop employee share ownership \noutside France, given the legal or fiscal dificulties or uncertainties \nthat could make it dificult to implement such a plan directly or \nindirectly through employee savings mutual funds in certain countries. \nIt shall be used only in the event of use of the delegation provided \nin the 19th resolution, with a sub-ceiling of €16 million included in \nthe overall ceiling of €32 million provided in the 19th resolution. As \nfor the 19th resolution, this resolution provides for the cancellation \nof pre-emptive subscription rights and would be granted for a \nperiod of eighteen months. The maximum discount authorized is \nthe same as in the 19th resolution.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, employee share ownership represented \n6.9% of the Company’s share capital.\n\nThe next employee share ownership plan should be implemented \nby December 31, 2021, at the latest, and will make it possible to \nincrease in the long-term employee share ownership to around \n10% of the Company’s share capital.\n\n\n\nREPORT OF ThE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND DRAFT RESOLUTIONS TO BE PRESENTED AT  \nThE COMBINED ShAREhOLDERS’ MEETING OF MAY 20, 2021\n\nResolutions presented at the Extraordinary Shareholders’ Meeting\n\nCAPGEMINI 351\n\n7.\n\nNINETEENTH RESOLUTION\n\nDelegation of authority to the Board of Directors, for a period of eighteen months, to issue, with cancellation of \npre‑emptive subscription rights, ordinary shares and/or securities granting access to the Company’s share capital \nto members of Capgemini group employee savings plans up to a maximum par value amount of €32\xa0million and at \na price set in accordance with the provisions of the French Labor Code\n\nThe Shareholders’ Meeting, voting in accordance with quorum and \nmajority rules for Extraordinary Shareholders’ Meetings, having \nread the Board of Directors’ report and the Statutory auditors’ \nspecial report and in accordance with Articles L. 225-129-2, \nL. 22-10-49, L. 225-129-6, L. 225-138-1 and L. 228-91 et seq. of the \nFrench Commercial Code and Articles L. 3332-18 to L. 3332-24 of \nthe French Labor Code:\n\n1.  delegates to the Board of Directors, with the power \nof sub-delegation to the extent authorized by law, the \nauthority to decide on the increase of the share capital with \ncancellation of pre-emptive subscription rights, on one or \nmore occasions, in France or abroad, in the proportions and \nat the times it sees fit, in euros or in any other currency or \ncurrency unit established by reference to more than one \ncurrency, with or without a share premium, whether for \nvaluable consideration or without consideration, by issuing \n(i) shares of the Company (excluding preference shares), and/\nor (ii) securities governed by Articles L. 228-92 paragraph 1, \nL. 228-93 paragraphs 1 and 3 or L. 228-94 paragraph 2 of the \nFrench Commercial Code granting access, immediately or \nin the future, at any time or at fixed dates, by subscription, \nconversion, exchange, redemption, presentation of a \nwarrant or any other means, to the share capital of the \nCompany, reserved for members of one or more employee \nsavings plans (or any other plan for whose members a share \ncapital increase may be reserved on equivalent terms under \nArticles L. 3332-1 et seq. of the French Labor Code or any \nanalogous law or regulation) implemented within a company \nor a group of French or non-French companies within the \nscope of the consolidated or combined financial statements \nof the Company pursuant to Article L. 3344-1 of the French \nLabor Code, it being further stipulated that this resolution \nmay be used to implement leveraged schemes;

The number \nof subscribers amounted to 40,989 employees, or 16.32% of the \neligible population, and similarly to the previous ESOP plans, the \ntransaction was oversubscribed to in the amount of 174%.\n\nThe newly-issued shares will be fully assimilated with the existing \nordinary shares comprising Capgemini’s share capital.

This price amounts to 106.20 euros.\n\nTheoretical share price after the transaction = ((the average of the \nlisted closing prices of the Capgemini share during the 20 stock \n\nmarket trading days preceding the fixing of the issuance price x the \nnumber of shares before the transaction) + (the issuance price x \nthe number of newly-issued shares))/(the number of shares before \nthe transaction + the number of newly-issued shares).\n\nThe issuance price of the reserved capital increase is set at 92.93 euros.\n\nAccounting for these assumptions, the theoretical post-transaction \nstock market value of the Capgemini share amounts to 105.93 euros.\n\nIt is recalled that this theoretical approach is provided for illustrative \npurposes and does not predict future evolutions in the share price.\n\n—\n\nThis supplementary report and the Statutory auditors’ report may be consulted by shareholders at the Company’s head ofice and \nwill be brought to the attention of shareholders at the next Shareholders’ Meeting.\n\nSigned in Paris, on December 2, 2020\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nAiman Ezzat\n\nSupplementary report of the Board of Directors on the issuance of shares under  \nthe Capgemini group “ESOP 2020” employee shareholding plan\n\n\n\nREPORT OF ThE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND DRAFT RESOLUTIONS TO BE PRESENTED AT  \nThE COMBINED ShAREhOLDERS’ MEETING OF MAY 20, 2021\n\nStatutory auditors’ special reports\n\nCAPGEMINI 359\n\n7.\n\n7.4 Statutory auditors’ special reports \n\nStatutory auditors’ report on the authorization to grant free shares  \n(existing or to be issued) to employees and corporate officers\n\nThis is a free translation into English of the Statutory auditors’ report issued in French and is provided solely for the convenience of English \nspeaking readers.

This \nsanction will apply for all Shareholders’ Meetings for a period of \ntwo years from the date on which the failure to disclose is rectified. \nThis request and the decision of the Shareholders’ Meeting must \nbe recorded in the minutes of the Shareholders’ Meeting.\n\nWhen calculating these “thresholds per the bylaws” the same \ninstances where shares and voting rights held by third parties \nare deemed equivalent to shares and voting rights held by the \nshareholder subject to legal disclosure requirements are applicable.\n\nhttp://investors.capgemini.com\n\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION \nLegal information\n\n366 2020 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT\n\n8.\n\n8.1.11  Shareholder identification\n\nThe Company can use available legal provisions to identify holders of bearer shares.\n\n8.1.12 Voting rights \n\nFollowing the decision of the Combined Shareholders’ Meeting \nof May 6, 2015 in its tenth resolution not to apply the provisions \nof Article L. 225-123 of the French Commercial Code regarding \ndouble voting rights, each share carries entitlement to one vote. \nThis includes fully-paid shares held in registered form for at least \n\ntwo years by the same shareholder and bonus registered shares \ngranted in respect of registered shares held for at least two years \nin the event of a share capital increase by capitalization of reserves, \nprofits or additional paid-in capital.\n\n8.1.13  Changes in shareholder rights\n\nChanges in the share capital or the rights attached to shares are subject to compliance with French company law alone, as the bylaws \ndo not contain any specific provisions in this respect.\n\n8.1.14  Rights, privileges and restrictions relating to shares\n\nIn addition to the voting right conferred by law, each share confers \nentitlement to a portion of the profits and any liquidation surplus, \nin direct proportion to the number and par value of outstanding \nshares.\n\nNo preferential rights are attached to any specific class of shares \nor category of shareholder.\n\n8.1.15  Provisions of the bylaws or other provisions that could delay, defer or \nprevent a change in control\n\nNot applicable.\n\n8.1.16  Factors affecting a potential takeover bid\n\nNo factors are subject to the provisions of Article L. 22-10-11 of the French Commercial Code.\n\n8.1.17  Provisions of the bylaws governing administrative and management \nbodies\n\nAppointment of directors and duration of  \nterms of office\n\nThe Company has a Board of Directors comprised of a minimum \nof three and a maximum of eighteen members, who must be \nindividuals.
